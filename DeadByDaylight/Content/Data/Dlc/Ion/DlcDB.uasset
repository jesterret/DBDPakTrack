Yet, such salvation comes with a price, for the creatures that dwell within are unknowable, their motivations concealed behind shimmering black eyes. Though there is comfort in their embrace, the darkness flows from them like ink spilling over a pale corpse.<br><br>Join the murderous flock as The Artist, a young woman transformed by The Entity into the matron of crows. Following her gruesome torture, she has gained the ability to summon ferocious winged fiends. Quickly send your servants to flight searching for Survivors and swarming them with beating wings.<br><br>Crack the code as Jonah Vasquez, a CIA codebreaker who’s a mathematical mastermind. Haunted by a mysterious set of numbers, he finally decoded the horrifying truth.
