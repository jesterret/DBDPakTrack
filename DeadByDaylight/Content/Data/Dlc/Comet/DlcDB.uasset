    UnlockDescription: Titans walk among us. Celebrities with million-dollar smiles dare us to rise above the humdrum of ordinary life. But behind the plastic skin and tousled hair lies something dark... something buried deep in the hearts of those who would do anything for power and fame. If you saw into the darkness, would you recognize it? Or would you let the allure of neon lights blind you to the truth?<br><br>Astonish the crowd as The Trickster, a celebrity whose killings fused art with murder. Continually seeking to validate his splendor, he killed in audacious ways to inflate his insatiable ego. A master of bladework, he unleashes a rapid-fire flurry of throwing knives at the unwashed masses.<br><br>Pull the plug on The Trickster’s party with Yun-Jin Lee, a no-nonsense music producer who’s focused on self-preservation. After hesitating to follow her instinct surrounding The Trickster’s serial murders, she was condemned to The Entity’s realm with him. Now the unresolved conflict between producer and idol plays out... endlessly.
