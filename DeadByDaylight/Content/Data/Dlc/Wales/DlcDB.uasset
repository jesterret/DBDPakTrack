    UnlockDescription: Darkness lurks deep within us. For all the power the supernatural possess, they are but mirrors that reflect our most gruesome desires and fears. As we peer through the fog and see ourselves for what we may truly be—selfish, vengeful, afraid—we must consider that we deserve the penance that befalls us. 

Take control of Pyramid Head, the iconic executioner who stalked the shadows of Silent Hill. Upon stepping into a swirling fog, he passed into a new realm requiring his sadistic talents. Great knife in tow, he's ready to unleash his twisted brand of punishment on all who cross him. 

Escape the cruel machinations of The Entity's trials with Cheryl Mason. A courageous, outspoken woman, she's survived the hellish Otherworld of Silent Hill, and exacted revenge on the Order that killed her father. With experience beyond her years, she's prepared to once again stand against any evil that confronts her.
