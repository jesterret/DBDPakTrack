Will we follow in the path of those before us or forge into uncharted territory?

Ambition brought him to The Entity's realm but his hunger for power destroyed him. Mutated and mad, his potent serums afford him unnatural animalistic abilities to track and ambush Survivors.<br><br>Plan your escape with Felix Richter, a successful architect who was torn away from his lavish lifestyle. Resourceful and bold, he has clever methods to stand against the oncoming evil and plan out the one thing that matters to him most—returning home.
