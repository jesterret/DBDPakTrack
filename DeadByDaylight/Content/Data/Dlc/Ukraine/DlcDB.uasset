    UnlockDescription: The Deathslinger, a former bounty hunter with a chip on his shoulder is the new Killer. Following the massacre of those who had betrayed him at Hellshire Penitentiary, The Deathslinger was lured into the Realm of The Entity where he now uses his unique invention—a rifle that fires a chain—to round up Survivors for The Entity. 

The new Survivor is Zarina Kassir, a modern day cowboy using her camera and filmmaking skills to help those who cannot help themselves. As she investigated the circumstances around the  ‘Mad Mick Massacre’ at Hellshire prison, she unravelled more than she bargained for.
