    Title: Dead by Daylight
    Description: In Dead by Daylight, you can take the role of an unstoppable Killer and hunt 4 Survivors, or play as one of 4 Survivors and try to make it out alive.

    Title: Asymmetry
    Description: Dead by Daylight is an asymmetric game. Each side in the trial has certain advantages and disadvantages:<br><br><b>The Killer</b> is an unstoppable, solitary monster. Killers see the world from a first person perspective. They each have heightened senses, deadly weapons and a unique power that helps them locate, chase, injure, catch and hook Survivors.<br><br><b>The Survivors</b> are a team of 4. They can choose to cooperate or to look out for themselves. Though they are weak and vulnerable, Survivors can use their small size to quickly vault through windows, leap over pallets, or find hiding spots. The Survivors have a wide third person perspective which gives them an advantage in situational awareness.

    Title: Game Goals
    Description: The two roles have very different goals.<br><br><b>The Survivors'</b> goal is to escape the trial. In order to do so, they must find and repair 5 generators. Once they are repaired, the generators power 2 exit gates. Each gate has a switch that must be held down for a short time before the gate will open and the Survivors can escape.<br><br><b>The Killer's</b> goal is to find and catch Survivors in order to hang them on sacrificial hooks to be consumed by The Entity. <br><br>If the <b>Endgame Collapse</b> is triggered, the Killer will have the added goal of keeping the Survivors within the trial until the timer expires. See the <b>Endgame Collapse</b> section for more information.

    Description: Survivors are very vulnerable and have few methods of fighting back against the Killer. To avoid being caught, they should start by learning how to hide. Basic strategies can include crouching behind obstacles, finding cover in tall grass, tucking into dark corners or getting into lockers. However, to avoid detection, Survivors must gain understanding of the Killer's heightened senses.<br><br><b>Scratch marks:</b> Running is louder than walking, but the real downside to running is the trail it leaves behind. These scratch marks can only be seen by the Killer. They disappear after a few seconds, but the trail they leave can lead the Killer straight to a running Survivor.<br><br><b>Loud Noises:</b> Some actions, such as window vaults, can be performed quickly or slowly (depending on whether the run button is held). Rushing these actions creates a loud noise signal that the Killer may see and hear. Be aware that these actions will give away your position. <br><br><b>Bloodstains:</b> Injured Survivors leave a trail of blood that is visible to all players. Survivors bleed regardless of whether they are walking or running. Bloodstains disappear after a few seconds.<br><br><b>Crows:</b> Crows are servants of The Entity.

    Title: Detecting the Killer
    Description: Most Killers are quite large and easy to spot. However, Survivors do have a few extra situational awareness advantages they can use to increase their odds of survival.<br><br><b>Third Person View:</b> Survivors have a versatile third person view which grants them 360 degree situational awareness. It can also be used to look around corners or over obstacles and locate the Killer without being seen.<br><br><b>Terror Radius:</b> The Killer's approach is signalled by a heartbeat. As the Killer gets closer, the heartbeat intensifies. Experienced Survivors can use the Terror Radius to accurately determine the distance between themselves and the Killer.<br><br><b>The Stain:</b> The Stain is an eerie red light emitted in front of the Killer. It is especially good for quickly determining where the Killer is looking. If you are in a chase and see the stain bathing your character in its red glow, don't panic. It's too late.

    Title: Skill Checks
    Description: While performing actions such as repairing, healing or sabotaging, Survivors will periodically trigger <b>Skill Checks</b>. A Skill Check is a quick challenge that requires the player to tap a button at the right time. There are three possible outcomes for a Skill Check.<br><br><b>Good Skill Check:</b> The button is pressed when the red line is within the outlined zone known as the "Good Zone". A good Skill Check allows the action to resume without penalty.<br><br><b>Great Skill Check:</b> The button is pressed when the red line is within the filled zone known as the "Great Zone". A great Skill Check allows the action to resume and grants a small bonus towards its progress.<br><br><b>Failed Skill Check:</b> The button is pressed when the red line is outside the good or great zone, or the button is not pressed at all. Failing a Skill Check creates a great deal of noise and penalizes the action's progress. <br><br>Survivors should always be focused and ready for a Skill Check to appear. They will hear an audio cue before a Skill Check is triggered.

    Title: Repairing Generators
    Description: The first step to complete in order to escape is to repair the 5 generators. There are a few things to keep in mind while doing so:<br><br><b>Generator Locations:</b> Generator locations are randomly selected before the trial, so they cannot simply be memorized. To find the generators, Survivors can try looking out for the flashing lights above them or listen out for the sounds of partially repaired generators.<br><br><b>Killer Patrols:</b> Killers can see the auras of unrepaired and partially repaired generators. When not engaged in a chase, Killers will often patrol the generators searching for Survivors. <br><br><b>Skill Checks:</b> Survivors should be listening out for the Skill Check audio cue while repairing generators. Failing a Skill Check will cause the generator to explode, which sets back the repair progress and alerts the Killer.<br><br><b>Careful Repairs:</b> Repairing a generator takes time and makes noise that can attract the Killer; Survivors need to be on their guard. It's a good idea to plan one or more escape routes in case the Killer approaches.<br><br><b>The Escape:</b> Once the <b>5</b> generators have been repaired, a level-wide siren will alert all players that the exit gates can be opened. Survivors will only be shown the exit locations for a limited time, so they will need to remember where they are. Many Survivors have been caught at the end of a trial searching the perimeter for the exit!<br><br>If the <b>Endgame Collapse</b> is triggered before all generators are repaired then they will become blocked off by The Entity.

    Title: Altruistic Actions
    Description: Survivors can increase their chances of escaping by taking care of each other. Here are the main actions that can help:<br><br><b>Healing:</b> Survivors can heal each other, even without a Med Kit.<br><br><b>Rescue:</b> Survivors can rescue each other from The Killer and the hook to prevent the sacrifice from happening. Three types of rescue attempts can be made. Each attempt gives you a scoring event that may also impact your perks, Killer powers, and add-ons.<br>Safe Hook Rescue: The unhooked Survivor is not downed within 10 seconds following the Rescue attempt.<br>Unsafe Hook Rescue: The unhooked Survivor is downed within 10 seconds following the Rescue attempt.<br>Shoulder Rescue: Survivors can attempt to blind or stun the Killer to make them drop a carried Survivor.<br><br>Though it is possible to play and escape as a lone wolf, it can prove more difficult once the other Survivors have been killed.

A sabotaged hook cannot be used by the Killer until it is repaired by The Entity.<br><br><b>Cleanse Totems:</b> Cleansing is a specific interaction performed on Totems. Cleansing a Totem destroys it and disables any Hex that was assigned to it.

    Title: Chases
    Description: When the Killer gets too close, it's time to run! Here are some things to keep in mind about chases:<br><br><b>Killer Speed:</b> Most Killers are faster than Survivors, and in long chases they will gain even more speed due to <b>Bloodlust</b> <i>(consult the status effect section of this guide for more details about Bloodlust)</i>.<br><br><b>Vaults:</b> Survivors can vault over windows and pallets very quickly. Killers traverse these obstacles slowly, so they can be used by Survivors to gain distance.<br><br><b>Break line of sight:</b> To survive a chase, a Survivor should try to break line of sight and head in a direction the Killer does not expect or cannot anticipate.<br><br><b>Pallets:</b> Pallets are objects the Survivors can throw down in order to put an obstacle between themselves and the Killer. Killers can be stunned by dropping a pallet on them directly. Pallets can only be dropped once, after which they can be vaulted by Survivors or destroyed by Killers.<br><br>Keeping these points in mind will help you make it out of the chase alive.

    Title: The Exit Gates
    Description: When the <b>5</b> generators have been repaired, the exit gates power up and become accessible. Their positions will be temporarily revealed to the Survivors. To open the gate, its switch must be held down for a few seconds. This is a crucial movement, as Survivors are exposed and vulnerable during this time. There's a good chance the Killer will head straight for one of the exits as soon as they become powered.<br><br>Once the gate is opened, Survivors can go through and escape. Survivors may also choose to stay in the trial and help other Survivors escape, but the <b>Endgame Collapse</b> will require they leave before the timer expires, or else The Entity will take them forcefully. Taking the risk of staying for others in need is a great way to earn more Bloodpoints and a good reputation.

    Title: Hooks & Sacrifice
    Description: The ultimate goal of the Killer is to sacrifice Survivors to The Entity. Once a Survivor is hung on a sacrificial hook, the sacrifice sequence will begin. It has 3 phases.<br><br><b>Phase 1: Summoning Phase</b><br>In this phase, The Entity is being summoned to the hook and takes some time to manifest. Hooked Survivors can be rescued or attempt to free themselves from the hook. These attempts have a 4% chance of success, and failure accelerates the summoning process.<br><br><b>Phase 2: Struggle Phase</b><br>Once The Entity has manifested itself around the hook, Survivors can no longer attempt to free themselves. They can only fight to survive. They may still be rescued by other Survivors.<br><br><b>Phase 3: Sacrifice Phase</b><br>The Entity will eventually overpower a hooked Survivor and devour them. The hook itself is destroyed at the end of the sacrifice sequence.<br><br>A Survivor who is rescued or escapes from the hook will progress to the next phase the next time they are hooked. For example, a Survivor who was freed in the summoning phase will progress immediately to the struggle phase the next time they are hooked. A Survivor who was freed during the the struggle phase and hooked again will be immediately sacrificed.

Successfully attacking a healthy Survivor puts them in the injured state.<br><br><b>Injured</b>: Even though they limp, injured Survivors have the same movement speed as when healthy. They leave behind trails of blood and make lots of noise which makes them easier to find. An injured Survivor who takes a second hit is put into the dying state.<br><br><b>Dying</b>: Survivors in the dying state can only crawl and are unable to interact or complete objectives. However, they are still able to escape if they can crawl to an opened Hatch or opened exit gate. Crawling Survivors can be picked up and placed on a hook to be sacrificed.

    Title: Survivor Awareness
    Description: Killers should be aware of the methods Survivors can use to locate them. Most Killers are very large, making them quite easy to see, but there are some other aspects to Survivor perception that are important to keep in mind:<br><br><b>Third Person View:</b> The Survivors have a wide third person perspective. The Survivor player is able to see behind their character and around corners.<br><br><b>Terror Radius:</b> Survivors hear a heartbeat when the Killer approaches. The closer the Killer is, the more intense the heartbeat.<br><br><b>The Stain:</b> Survivors can see an eerie red light emitted in front of the Killer. The stain can give away the Killer's position as well as the direction in which they are looking.<br><br><i>Consult</i> <i><b>"The Survivors"</b></i> <i>section of this guide to learn more about the Survivors' abilities.</i>

At the end of each trial, you are awarded pips based on your performance. Earning enough pips increases your class. For example, if you were in Ash IV, you would move up to Ash III.<br><br>If you are at the top of your grade you would move to the next grade. For example, if you were in Silver I, you would move up to Gold IV.<br><br>Grades are reset on the 13th of every month. Bloodpoints are awarded based on the highest grade you have achieved during the month.<br><br><b>NOTE:</b> Custom games are unranked and will not affect grades.
