    Title: Dead by Daylight
    Description: In Dead by Daylight, you can take the role of an unstoppable Killer and hunt 4 Survivors, or play as one of 4 Survivors and try to make it out alive. Read this guide to learn the basics of the game.<br><br>The guide is divided into 3 sections: <b>The Game</b>, <b>The Killer</b> and <b>The Survivors</b>.

    Title: Asymmetry
    Description: Dead by Daylight is an asymmetric game. Each side in the trial has certain advantages and disadvantages:<br><br><b>The Killer</b> is an unstoppable, solitary monster. Killers see the world from a first person perspective. They each have heightened senses, deadly weapons and a unique power that helps them locate, chase, injure, catch and hook Survivors.<br><br><b>The Survivors</b> are a team of 4. They can choose to cooperate or to look out for themselves. Though they are weak and vulnerable, Survivors can use their small size to quickly vault through windows, leap over pallets, or find hiding spots. The Survivors have a wide third person perspective which gives them an advantage in situational awareness.

    Title: Game Goals
    Description: The two roles have very different goals.<br><br><b>The Survivors'</b> goal is to escape the trial. In order to do so, they must find and repair 5 generators. Once they are repaired, the generators power 2 Exit Gates. Each gate has a switch that must be held down for a short time before the gate will open and the Survivors can escape.<br><br><b>The Killer's</b> goal is to find and catch Survivors in order to hang them on sacrificial hooks to be consumed by The Entity. <br><br>If the <b>Endgame Collapse</b> is triggered, the Killer will have the added goal of keeping the Survivors within the Trial until the timer expires. See the <b>Endgame Phase</b> section for more information.

You progress through the bloodweb by collecting and spending bloodpoints.<br><br>Each character has their own bloodweb which represents their level and general progress. Collecting all nodes on a bloodweb increases that character's level and generates a new, larger, bloodweb. At level <b>10</b>, The Entity awakens and begins to consume nodes on a character's bloodweb, so players must prioritize the nodes they want to reach before The Entity does. Although the maximum level is capped at <b>50</b>, players can carry on completing bloodwebs and generating new ones indefinitely. <br><br>At level <b>50</b>, a character is eligible for <b>prestige</b>.

Though an injured Survivor limps, their movement speed is the same as when healthy. Taking damage while injured puts a Survivor into the dying state.<br><br><b>Dying:</b> While dying, a Survivor's movement is limited to a slow crawl. A crawling Survivor has two options: recover as much health as they can, or crawl to find help. Without the aid of specialized perks, a Survivor cannot recover fully; they will need another Survivor to finish healing them.

    Description: Survivors are very vulnerable and have few methods of fighting back against the Killer. To avoid being caught, they should start by learning how to hide. Basic strategies can include crouching behind obstacles, finding cover in tall grass, tucking into dark corners or getting into lockers. However, to avoid detection, Survivors must gain understanding of the Killer's heightened senses.<br><br><b>Scratch Marks:</b> Running is louder than walking, but the real downside to running is the trail it leaves behind. These scratch marks can only be seen by the Killer. They disappear after a few seconds, but the trail they leave can lead the Killer straight to a running Survivor.<br><br><b>Loud Noises:</b> Some actions, such as window vaults, can be performed quickly or slowly (depending on whether the run button is held). Rushing these actions creates a loud noise signal that the Killer may see and hear. Be aware that these actions will give away your position. <br><br><b>Bloodstains:</b> Injured Survivors leave a trail of blood that is visible to all players. Survivors bleed regardless of whether they are walking or running. Bloodstains disappear after a few seconds.<br><br><b>Crows:</b> Crows are servants of The Entity. Survivors who startle them or get too close will cause them to caw loudly and take flight, which can tip off an attentive Killer.<br><br><b>Failed Skill Checks:</b> A failed Skill Check will create a loud noise signal for the Killer. Be very careful after failing a Skill Check! <br><br><i>Consult <b>"The Killers"</b> section of this guide for more information on the Killer's abilities.</i>

It can also be used to look around corners or over obstacles and locate the Killer without being seen.<br><br><b>Terror Radius:</b> The Killer's approach is signalled by a heartbeat. As the Killer gets closer, the heartbeat intensifies. Experienced Survivors can use the Terror Radius to accurately determine the distance between themselves and the Killer.<br><br><b>The Stain:</b> The Stain is an eerie red light emitted in front of the Killer. It is especially good for quickly determining where the Killer is looking. If you are in a chase and see the stain bathing your character in its red glow, don't panic. It's too late.

    Description: While performing actions such as repairing, healing or sabotaging, Survivors will periodically trigger <b>Skill Checks</b>. A Skill Check is a quick challenge that requires the player to tap a button at the right time. There are three possible outcomes for a Skill Check.<br><br><b>Good Skill Check:</b> The button is pressed when the red line is within the outlined zone known as the "Good Zone". A good Skill Check allows the action to resume without penalty.<br><br><b>Great Skill Check:</b> The button is pressed when the red line is within the filled zone known as the "Great Zone". A great Skill Check allows the action to resume and grants a small bonus towards its progress.<br><br><b>Failed Skill Check:</b> The button is pressed when the red line is outside the good or great zone, or the button is not pressed at all. Failing a Skill Check creates a great deal of noise and penalizes the action's progress. <br><br>Survivors should always be focused and ready for a Skill Check to appear. They will hear an audio cue before a Skill Check is triggered.

    Title: Repairing Generators
    Description: The first step to complete in order to escape is to repair the 5 generators. There are a few things to keep in mind while doing so:<br><br><b>Generator Locations:</b> Generator locations are randomly selected before the trial, so they cannot simply be memorized. To find the generators, Survivors can try looking out for the flashing lights above them or listen out for the sounds of partially repaired generators.<br><br><b>Killer Patrols:</b> Killers can see the auras of unrepaired and partially repaired generators. When not engaged in a chase, Killers will often patrol the generators searching for Survivors. <br><br><b>Skill Checks:</b> Survivors should be listening out for the Skill Check audio cue while repairing generators. Failing a Skill Check will cause the generator to explode, which sets back the repair progress and alerts the Killer.<br><br><b>Careful Repairs:</b> Repairing a generator takes time and makes noise that can attract the Killer; Survivors need to be on their guard. It's a good idea to plan one or more escape routes in case the Killer approaches.<br><br><b>The Escape:</b> Once the <b>5</b> generators have been repaired, a level-wide siren will alert all players that the Exit Gates can be opened. Survivors will only be shown the exit locations for a limited time, so they will need to remember where they are. Many Survivors have been caught at the end of a trial searching the perimeter for the exit!<br><br>If the <b>Endgame Collapse</b> is triggered before all Generators are repaired then they will become blocked off by the Entity.

    Description: Survivors can increase their chances of escaping by taking care of each other. Here are the main actions that can help:<br><br><b>Healing:</b> Survivors can heal each other, even without a Med Kit.<br><br><b>Rescue:</b> Survivors can rescue each other from The Killer and the hook to prevent the sacrifice from happening. Three types of rescue attempts can be made. Each attempt gives you a scoring event that may also impact your perks, Killer powers, and add-ons.<br>Safe Hook Rescue: The unhooked Survivor is not downed within 10 seconds following the Rescue attempt.<br>Unsafe Hook Rescue: The unhooked Survivor is downed within 10 seconds following the Rescue attempt.<br>Shoulder Rescue: Survivors can attempt to blind or stun the Killer to make them drop a carried Survivor.<br><br>Though it is possible to play and escape as a lone wolf, it can prove more difficult once the other Survivors have been killed.

    Description: With the proper items or perks, Survivors can sabotage the Killer's tools. Strategic sabotage can be useful and even save lives. <br><br><b>Sabotage Hooks:</b> The hooks found around the map (but not in the basement) can be temporarily disabled by sabotage. A sabotaged hook cannot be used by the Killer until it is repaired by The Entity.<br><br><b>Cleanse Totems:</b> Cleansing is a specific interaction performed on totems. Cleansing a totem destroys it and disables any Hex that was assigned to it. Cleansing does not require any perks or items.<br><br>These actions generate a great deal of noise and will notify the Killer when they are completed!

    Title: Chases
    Description: When the Killer gets too close, it's time to run! Here are some things to keep in mind about chases:<br><br><b>Killer Speed:</b> Most Killers are faster than Survivors, and in long chases they will gain even more speed due to <b>bloodlust</b> <i>(consult the status effect section of this guide for more details about bloodlust)</i>.<br><br><b>Vaults:</b> Survivors can vault over windows and pallets very quickly. Killers traverse these obstacles slowly, so they can be used by Survivors to gain distance.<br><br><b>Break line of sight:</b> To survive a chase, a Survivor should try to break line of sight and head in a direction the Killer does not expect or cannot anticipate.<br><br><b>Pallets:</b> Pallets are objects the Survivors can throw down in order to put an obstacle between themselves and the Killer. Killers can be stunned by dropping a pallet on them directly. Pallets can only be dropped once, after which they can be vaulted by Survivors or destroyed by Killers.<br><br>Keeping these points in mind will help you make it out of the chase alive.

    Description: When the <b>5</b> generators have been repaired, the Exit Gates power up and become accessible. Their positions will be temporarily revealed to the Survivors. To open the gate, its switch must be held down for a few seconds. This is a crucial movement, as Survivors are exposed and vulnerable during this time. There's a good chance the Killer will head straight for one of the exits as soon as they become powered.<br><br>Once the gate is opened, Survivors can go through and escape. Survivors may also choose to stay in the trial and help other Survivors escape, but the <b>Endgame Collapse</b> will require they leave before the timer expires, or else the Entity will take them forcefully. Taking the risk of staying for others in need is a great way to earn more bloodpoints and a good reputation.

    Title: Hooks & Sacrifice
    Description: The ultimate goal of the Killer is to sacrifice Survivors to The Entity. Once a Survivor is hung on a sacrificial hook, the sacrifice sequence will begin. It has 3 phases.<br><br><b>Phase 1: Summoning Phase</b><br>In this phase, The Entity is being summoned to the hook and takes some time to manifest. Hooked Survivors can be rescued or attempt to free themselves from the hook. These attempts have a 4% chance of success, and failure accelerates the summoning process.<br><br><b>Phase 2: Struggle Phase</b><br>Once The Entity has manifested itself around the hook, Survivors can no longer attempt to free themselves. They can only fight to survive. They may still be rescued by other Survivors.<br><br><b>Phase 3: Sacrifice Phase</b><br>The Entity will eventually overpower a hooked Survivor and devour them. The hook itself is destroyed at the end of the sacrifice sequence.<br><br>A Survivor who is rescued or escapes from the hook will progress to the next phase the next time they are hooked. For example, a Survivor who was freed in the summoning phase will progress immediately to the struggle phase the next time they are hooked. A Survivor who was freed during the the struggle phase and hooked again will be immediately sacrificed.

When fully depleted, the item is retained, but it may no longer be used during that trial.<br><br>If a Survivor dies during a trial, any carried items are lost. If a Survivor escapes, any items they were carrying will be banked in that Survivor's inventory. These banked items will have full charge if used in another trial.<br><br>Add-ons are lost at the end of a trial, even if the item is retained.

    Title: Patrolling Generators
    Description: When the trial begins, the first thing most Killers will try to do is locate some Survivors. Survivors must repair generators to escape, so Killers are likely to encounter Survivors in the surrounding areas. Fortunately, Killers can read the auras of generators that require repairs, allowing them to see their outlines with unlimited range.<br><br>There are 7 generators in a typical trial. Try to find an efficient patrol route to protect them.<br><br>A generator in progress is a good sign that a Survivor is nearby, so Killers should keep their eyes peeled in this situation.<br><br>If the Survivors manage to repair 5 generators or the <b>Endgame Collapse</b> is triggered, the Exit Gates regain power and may be opened, allowing the Survivors to escape.<br><br>Once the <b>Endgame Collapse</b> begins, all Generators will be blocked off by the Entity.

    Description: Another way for Killers to track Survivors is by following the bloodstains that they leave behind while injured or dying. Bloodstains are harder to see than scratch marks, but are more accurate and a Survivor cannot stop bleeding until they heal. Blood in front of a locker, for example, is a dead giveaway. Like the scratch marks, bloodstains will disappear after a few seconds.

    Description: Vaulting is the action of going through a window or over a pallet. Survivors can vault a window slowly and quietly, or quickly and loudly. By running straight at a window, Survivors can pick up some extra speed for their vault. Most Killers are not in a hurry and only have one window vault speed: <i>slow</i>.<br><br>Pallets are found around the map and can be dropped by Survivors to create obstacles for the Killer. Killers cannot vault over pallets, but they can take time to <b>destroy</b> them by interacting with them.

    Title: Survivors' Health States
    Description: Survivors have 3 health states: <b>healthy</b>, <b>injured</b> and <b>dying</b>.<br>As a Killer, here's what each health state means to you:<br><br><b>Healthy</b>: The health state in which Survivors start. Successfully attacking a healthy Survivor puts them in the injured state.<br><br><b>Injured</b>: Even though they limp, injured Survivors have the same movement speed as when healthy. They leave behind trails of blood and make lots of noise which makes them easier to find. An injured Survivor who takes a second hit is put into the dying state.<br><br><b>Dying</b>: Survivors in the dying state can only crawl and are unable to interact or complete objectives. However, they are still able to escape if they can crawl to a Hatch or open an Exit Gate. Crawling Survivors can be picked up and placed on a hook to be sacrificed. If not healed, they will eventually bleed out and die.

    Description: The Killer can perform two <i>basic attacks</i>: a <b>quick attack</b> and a <b>lunge attack</b>.<br><br><b>The quick attack</b> is performed by simply activating the attack interaction. As the name implies, it is quick but has a very short range.<br><br>The<b> lunge attack</b> is performed by holding down the attack interaction. It provides greater reach, but can take some practice to master.<br><br>Missing an attack triggers a short cooldown during which the Killer's speed is reduced. Killers must be careful to properly aim and time their attacks, or risk allowing Survivors to escape.<br><br>Hitting a healthy Survivor grants them a brief burst of speed. Keep a close eye on their movements during this time in order to continue the pursuit.

Their struggles will affect the Killer's movements. The Survivor will eventually succeed and escape the Killer's grasp, so there is a limited time to transport the Survivor. Fortunately, Killers are able to see the auras of available hooks while they are carrying Survivors. Try to plan an efficient route.<br><br>Watch out for other Survivors while transporting a victim, as any action that stuns or blinds a Killer will free any carried Survivors.<br><br>If a Killer intentionally drops a Survivor, they will remain in the crawling state.
