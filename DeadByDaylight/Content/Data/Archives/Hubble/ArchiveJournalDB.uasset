                    Text: Ji-Woon lives within the sounds of Rio de Janeiro. Water splashes into a basin; a skateboard’s wheels grind over asphalt; a rufous-bellied thrush chirps, and… the voice. The angelic, ethereal sound of a young Brazilian man singing floats from an open window. Ji-Woon knows the man. Lucas.<br><br>He’s good. Nowhere near my level, but a diamond, nonetheless.<br><br>His voice is the brush stroke Ji-Woon has been searching for. To think, Lucas practically fell into his lap, the Brazilian man having sung at a recording studio Ji-Woon visited.<br><br>With Lucas' voice, Ji-Woon can create art. Genuine, agonizing art. Silky, bloodcurdling terror.<br><br>Ji-Woon has already prepared a warehouse at an abandoned harbor for tomorrow’s act. Even the most mundane detail required his attention. In the past week he’s transitioned between concert rehearsals to disguising his celebrity visage, staking out his victim, assuming alternate identities, purchasing supplies, and stealing recording equipment—all while paying off his security detail to leave him be. The mundane details are what elevate the splendor of his artwork.<br><br>Lucas will be dead in a day. And it will be beautiful.

                    Text: Ji-Woon freezes as he reaches his hotel room, the door opened a crack. He faintly hears someone rummaging inside. So be it. He knew a crazed fan would take things too far someday. How could they resist him? But he's ready. He'll defend himself, test the invader for operatic sounds, like an impromptu aria, as he surprises them with a blade in their gut.<br><br>He pats the knife concealed above his ankle. Ready. Pushes the door open, steps softly on plush carpet, hears the invader around the corner, sees… Yun-Jin? His manager.<br><br>Fury meets fury.<br><br>How dare you step foot in here!<br><br>Where the hell have you been?<br><br>She's paranoid about death threats they've been getting from a fan. When security couldn't locate Ji-Woon, she came snooping. It's laughable, the threats were nothing but a ploy, a boogeyman he created to throw Yun off his trail if she ever got too close. But he should have expected this. Yun's on top of everything—it's what he respects in her, what makes them a great team. He brings the million-dollar voice and she smashes through any problem in their way. Usually, it works in his favor.<br><br>In her hand she holds… no, damnit! His sampler. It contains his personal project, the screams of his murder victims layered into songs. It's an early draft lacking subtlety, the violence and horror a bit too blatant for the faint of heart. She's disgusted. Couldn't hear beyond the terrorized voices to understand the beauty inherent in human suffering. The hairs on Ji-Woon's neck stand on end. He sees the moment with clear eyes: they're dancing on a razor's edge, with Yun dangerously close to discovering who he truly is.

                    Text: Yun holds the sampler as if it's dripping blood. The only solace in Ji-Woon's mind is that she doesn't understand what it really is. He knows her. If she thought the sounds were actual murders, she'd have tried to knee him in the crotch and run. But the anger still rattles through her, as she moves up to his face.<br><br>What is this twisted horror bullshit? What if this leaked? You're already attracting crazed, violent fans, how would it look if the media heard the demented sounds you're working on? Mightee One would drop you. Your career would be dead.<br><br>Ji-Woon knows what she really fears: her career would be dead. For as tall as she stands, as strong as she swings, she's nothing but a scared girl afraid of failure. He knows how to play her. Drops his head, breathes deeply, wipes the back of his hand over his eyes.<br><br>Yun… Ever since the death of No Spin… the fire… I'm riddled with horrid thoughts. I lost my friends and… I fear I'm losing my mind. I see awful things behind closed eyes. All that guides me through the dark fog is turning my pain into sound… pouring the throes of death from my heart to a song.<br><br>Yun's face softens. She sits. Commiserates with him. Inside, he's reliving the divine screams of his bandmates as they burned, his swelling heart as they screamed his name, but on his face he shows nothing but contortions of tragedy.<br><br>She excuses his error in judgment. Confiscates the sampler. Requests he stay on hotel grounds until the concert is over. It's for his own good. His safety. She tells him to get a drink from the mini-bar and cool down.<br><br>He quietly nods and complies, reminding himself to steal back the sampler in a few days. He lets her pretend she has what he's holding: control.

                    Text: Despite the stifling humidity, Ji-Woon hides under a hoodie, large sunglasses concealing his face. Now's not the time to attract attention from rabid fans. He waits till Yun is in a meeting and strolls out of the hotel, a bag of necessities in hand. It's his show now.<br><br>He pulls earbuds from his pocket, allows the music to envelope him. The song: How I Became, recorded six months ago in Seoul. It stands as a metaphor for his childhood, written one drunken night while looking over old photographs.<br><br>He is seven years old. He sits at the back of the class. He's uncomfortable being seen and speaking. But today is different. In a few minutes he's presenting on his favorite thing. A young boy shows the class his hamster, but Ji-Woon doesn't care. He holds his flute, going over the notes to the song he wrote.<br><br>He shuffles to the front of the class, places his sweaty fingers on the instrument. Following a deep, unsteady breath, he gently blows out a wisp of air, creating a light, whimsical sound. He closes his eyes, moves his fingers precisely, playfully dancing over each note. He ignores the squeaks of the hamster. The flute's sound carries like chimes in the wind. With one final soul-piercing note, he smiles and opens his eyes. His classmates are huddled around the rodent, laughing with its every move. His teacher too.<br><br>He walks to the group. Students pass the hamster around as it squeaks incessantly. It finds itself directed into Ji-Woon's palm. He takes it in both hands. With one steady movement, he squeezes. A squeal. A slight crunch. No more sound. The children scream. Ji-Woon feels nothing.

                    Text: Storm clouds overtake the sky as the first drops of rain spatter onto Ji-Woon's sunglasses. He breathes deeply, prepares for what he's played over in his mind. The anticipation nearly brings him to his knees. The joy of the artistic process.<br><br>He strides to the rear door of a cheap 1980's sedan, glances both ways and appraises the few locals walking the street. Certain no one's watching, he jams a straightened coat hanger around the top of the window, pushing it through the other side. His thin fingers work quickly. Prior experience in breaking and entry pays off. He hooks the wire around the door lock and flicks it up. Without missing a beat, he slides inside, closes the door, and flattens himself along the backseat. He takes off his hoodie and sunglasses.<br><br>From his bag he pulls out rope, a blade, a dusty rag, and a bottle of chloroform. He waits. Takes out his earbuds. Listens to a song that's not his own. One he heard long ago.<br><br>He is eight years old. He sits on his father's shoulders, looking over a sea of human bodies. An elaborate stage is ahead, illuminated by colored spotlights. A man in gaudy, audacious clothing stands in front of a microphone. On each side is a guitarist, behind him, a drummer. A crash of sound. Beautiful, rhythmic music. A voice that twists delicately through the melody.<br><br>His father shouts something but he can't hear. Shouts again.<br><br>This is what you'll do. This is where your talent will take you.<br><br>He feels a tingle through his spine, and sees something incredible: everyone enraptured, focused intently on the sound of a single man. The emotion of thousands is guided by his voice. He is seen by all, he is loved, and he is wonderous.<br><br>Ji-Woon never played his flute again. He reveled in sounds that reached global audiences, attracted screaming fans, turned men and women into idols. His childhood fear vanished as he learned to divulge himself through the intricacy and pliability of pop, his inner thoughts riding atop soundwaves, fusing together with other genres—rock, hip hop, jazz, punk. It was the music that could deliver him the explosive fame he deserved, a promise that he would never be upstaged. He was no longer confined to his timid shell; he revealed himself through his mastery of music, poured his heart into sound. He became envied, lusted over, and respected for the hits that spilled from his lungs.<br><br>He takes the earbuds in his hands and smiles. How miraculous that a boy became a god.

                    Text: Rain hammers down on the car's roof. Ji-Woon checks the time. On any other day, Lucas would be in his car already. He knows this, he's done his homework. But Lucas is late, and Ji-Woon wonders if the storm has altered plans.<br><br>He feels control slipping away, replaced by something else. It pushes against his chest. Forces him to gasp for air, heavy and sticky in his lungs. Everything's ruined. He claws his nails into the car seat, forces his mouth shut to keep himself from screaming. All the planning for nothing. He doesn't have time before leaving Brazil to find another beautiful voice. Quickly… he needs music, fumbles for his earbuds, drops them to the floor, frantically scours. The only song playing is his teeth audibly grinding. As he prepares to spill into the street, he sees him. Lucas, drenched under the deluge, walks to the driver's side door.<br><br>Get your shit together. The show's about to begin.<br><br><b>***</b><br><br>Ji-Woon grabs Lucas' neck in a chokehold, shoves the chloroform-soaked cloth into his face. The two struggle in a frenzied dance. Lucas twists from side to side, reaching his arms back, grabbing for anything. Ji-Woon resists the movement, holding the man in place with all his might. Rain smashes down, muting the battle under the pattering of a hundred drops, concealing the outside behind a windshield of streaming water. Lucas grabs a handful of hair and pulls Ji-Woon forward, breaking the chokehold. He bites deep into Ji-Woon's wrist, drawing blood. Ji-Woon screams through gritted teeth, pushing the cloth harder into Lucas' face until he's beating him with it. Lucas flails his other arm in a desperate bid, searching for a solution with no plan. His hand relaxes, releasing Ji-Woon's hair. He slumps forward, head hitting the steering wheel, blasting the horn.<br><br>Ji-Woon scurries over the seat, pushes Lucas' limp body to the passenger side. He leans back, takes a moment to catch his breath. Looks in the rearview mirror, inspects his face, hair, and, through a sheet of rain, sees a sight he never expected: Yun's car pulling up behind him.<br><br>He grabs the keys from Lucas' pocket, jams them in the ignition and slams the accelerator down.

                    Text: Lucas' limp body jostles back and forth in the passenger seat. Streetside shops and graffitied walls are a blur as Ji-Woon veers around a corner. Wind and rain lash at the city as if dead-set on blowing it apart.  Ji-Woon loses track of his plan. Usually, he would have Yun fix his problems, but now—it's all wrong. He doesn't recognize the streets he's speeding down, only has a vague idea of the direction. Yun remains on his tail. She doesn't know when to quit. The tenacity and courage that proved useful when negotiating his record deal is infuriating now. He's losing control of his artistic process. Hands squeeze the wheel. He'd rip it from the steering column if he could.<br><br>No… no! You're not going down like this. You have art to make, damnit.<br><br>He flicks on the radio. Two men talking about… something. He doesn't know. Searches the channels—a commercial for a fast-food restaurant. Recognizes the jingle. Keeps going, lands on—there it is, Brazilian dance music. Rapid tempo, heavy bass line, percussive guitar notes, and a smooth voice.<br><br>He pushes the pedal to the floor, dodges a few kids playing in the storm. Bolts past an old pickup truck, praying no one comes the other way. Swings the wheel hard to the left, nearly loses control in deep water but recovers to find himself in a perfect turn. Guns it as the song hits the chorus. Trusts in the music. Shifts with the tempo. Slides with the riffs. Feels the beauty in everything he does. Music courses through him. He is living art. He is the crescendo.<br><br>Behind him, Yun's car comes to a crashing halt.<br><br>It doesn't matter. The music goes on.

                    Text: Ji-Woon pulls into the harbor he'd staked out days ago. He reluctantly turns off the radio and scans the area. No sign of Yun behind him but he's on his guard. Somehow she knew how to find him. He pulls out his phone… his Mightee One company phone.<br><br>She's tracking me like an overzealous babysitter. Should have expected this from her… always a micromanager.<br><br>But she couldn't have known he was driving the car—only that he was in it.<br><br>Ji-Woon drags out Lucas, barely conscious, and pushes a blade into this back. Before shutting the door, he takes his phone and texts a simple message to Yun: HELP. He tosses the device on the car seat along with the rag of chloroform and rope. Hm, needs more evidence. He cuts his palm and presses a bloody hand to the window. That'll do.<br><br>With a thrust of his blade, he pushes Lucas forward.<br><br><b>***</b><br><br>Thunder shakes the frame of the abandoned warehouse. Lucas sits in front of Ji-Woon, bound to a chair, ready to be slaughtered, to sing, to create beauty. Ji-Woon pulls out his blade but… hesitates. Something's wrong. He was too messy getting here. He wants to dive into his art, let the blood spill, but Yun threw him off his game. He can't shake the feeling; he knows she doesn't give up easily… or at all. Walks over to a window and looks out. Endless rain. Lightning. And there, like a drowned rat skulking through sewage—Yun. So damn persistent. And further back… the flashing lights of a police car. Yun's stumbled into a bloody game and has the power to end him in one move.<br><br>He rummages through his pockets for his earbuds. Can't find them. Can't focus. Feels the plan slipping away. Sees an end to his art. The music cut short. His vision incomplete.<br><br>No… he can't let it end. He hears the music. It's always been there. Sitting on his father's shoulders, washing over him. He inhales it. It circulates through his veins. Becomes him. He'll never go back to being the boy he once was. He's an idol. He's a god. He's The Trickster. And he has one last trick to play…

                    Text: Fatigued from the long flight, Yun-Jin yawns as she turns on her laptop. She landed in Rio De Janeiro just two hours ago, but her work cannot wait. Looking through her mailbox, she spots a dozen unread emails from an unknown user addressing her by name. Few know her as Yun-Jin. Most only know her as Magnum Opus. She clicks on an email. <br><br> A graphic, detailed description of someone's plan to murder her and the Trickster. Signed, the Trickster's number one fan. Death threat. An abnormally specific one with a picture of her in the hotel lobby. <br><br>Before the death of NO SPIN, she ignored such threats. But now… her manicured hand shake as she reaches for her phone. <br><br>The threat is too serious to be taken lightly. She calls her security crew for an emergency meeting. Outings are restricted to recording sessions and concert rehearsals only. A bodyguard is assigned to the Trickster and herself. <br><br>Everyone complies with the new rules except for the Trickster, who argues against staying on the hotel premises. No surprises there. Her relationship with the Trickster has been on the rocks for months now. He challenges every decision she makes, his ego pushing her patience to its limit. Because of their frequent creative disagreements, their next album is behind schedule, forcing her to produce three new songs while overseeing his tour. <br><br>Her security expert confirms that the phones are ready. At her request, a tracking GPS application was installed on all company phones. No one else knows about this. If the Trickster keeps testing her patience, this app will come in handy. It's for his own good. And hers.

                    Text: Yun-Jin pours herself a cup of coffee at the recording studio, stifling another yawn. Her temples are throbbing. The jet lag is hitting her hard. Plus the constant threat of a crazed fan prevents her from getting any sleep at night.  <br><br>On her way back to the booth, she notices that the studio next to theirs is occupied. She peeks inside. A young man is laughing in the recording booth. He has an easy-going smile that could sell thousands of magazines. She recognizes the man at the mix table: Allano Muse, a semi-famous producer from San Diego. <br><br>What is he doing in Rio? Some bits of fresh gossip could help reenergize her. She taps on the door's window. <br><br>The door creaks open. <br><br>He remembers her of course. Who could forget the Magnum Opus? <br><br>She invites herself in as he plays the track he is working on. A slow, predictable build for the baseline. Formulaic. Too safe to be of any interest. Then, an ethereal voice fills the room. Yun-Jin almost spills her coffee. The artist's voice is crystalline. His range is powerful yet nuanced. <br><br>Who is that? <br><br>Allano tells Lucas, the young artist, to drop down his pitch a notch. Bad call. The track should be building up to push Lucas' range instead of confining it to a boring, generic sound. She walks up to Lucas and hands him her business card. <br><br>Contact me when you're ready to become a serious artist. <br><br>A pang of regret hits her on her way out. She said those exact words to the Trickster, many years ago. Back then, she looked forward to working with him. <br><br>Those days are long gone.

                    Text: At the hotel bar, Yun-Jin takes a sip of her cold Caipirinha, the sugarcane liquor smoothening the sour burst of lime. <br><br>Why did she give that young artist, Lucas, her business card? It's not like she can produce him. Another pang of nostalgia. Another sip of Caipirinha. She misses it. Hunting new talents. The raw creative chaos of designing a bold sound. The adrenaline rush of the first album. Things are different now. Her time is split between handling the Trickster's growing ego, and following a generic, endless production cycle. <br><br>Is this the cost of success? Producing music that makes her cringe? Not to mention handling arguments about bodyguards and curfews while being threatened by a crazed, psychotic fan. <br><br>Her life is so different from what she imagined as a little girl. Back then, music was the only good thing she had. She created tracks in her bedroom, imagining a stage of bright lights where she was safe, loud, and free. That is what Pop music is to her: a vital dose of unapologetic release. But now, thanks to her success, she lives in a golden cage. <br><br>Down goes the Caipirinha. <br><br>The bartender gives her a glance and she nods. Keep them coming. <br><br>She calls Mightee One executives for a virtual meeting and gives them the news. Once she finishes the three tracks in Rio, she is done with the Trickster. She will move on to producing the launch of trainees. <br><br>A Mightee One executive cuts her off. They have more urgent business to discuss. Damaging rumors are trending online. A disturbed, delusional fan claims to have murdered someone at a Trickster concert. Yun-Jin closes her fists, her long manicured nails digging into her palms. Anything to keep her hands from shaking again. <br><br>She will handle this mediatic storm—for her brand's sake. But after Rio, she is done with the Trickster. Whether Mightee One is willing or not.

                    Text: Online, rumors about the murder are trending. An anonymous post claims that the victim was last seen alive at the Trickster's VIP meet-up after his concert in New York early this year. Yun-Jin remembers that night. Not because of the concert, but because of a detail that has been replaying in her mind ever since. Bleeding scratch marks on the Trickster's forearms when he showed up at the concert’s afterparty. The rumors online were rekindling the suspicion she silenced before. <br><br>Years ago, the Trickster and she arrived in Miami several days earlier than planned. Yun-Jin attended networking events while the Trickster rehearsed. Three days following their arrival, a folksinger was found dead downtown, near the bar where he performed. A security footage was released to the public showing a man dressed in black with his face covered, leading the singer down an alley. The dark, blurry footage revealed little about the suspect. But Yun-Jin noticed a detail that twisted her stomach in knots. She recognized the gold rimmed headphones around the suspect’s neck with two large “Xs”, one for each ear. It was the brand-new model of the Xerxes 1050x headphones, which few audiophiles knew about and even fewer could afford. She recognized the model right away because the Trickster favored their equipment over other expensive models. He wore a similar pair on the plane to Miami, but then switched to a lesser model for the rest of the tour, which only fueled her doubts. <br><br>Back then, however, she was not in a good place. The death of NO SPIN was still fresh. Acute insomnia kept her mind in a haze and the jet lag of the tour only worsened her state. In the end, she decided to let the police do their job and focus on hers; producing music. But now someone else was dead, someone whom the Trickster might have been the last one to see alive. The headphones, the scratch marks, and the late-night outs were details, but they added up. <br><br>How many coincidences does it take to know? <br><br>A knock on the door makes her jump. The head of security is here. Yun-Jin follows her gut. She confronts him. She bluffs about firing the whole security crew if he does not come clean. It pays off. She learns that the Trickster left the hotel premises last night. His bodyguard tried to follow but lost him on the way. <br><br>Yun-Jin pounds her fist on the table. <br><br> Why would he leave the hotel? To go where? And… to do what? <br><br>Despite working with the Trickster for years, he is still no more than a stranger. While he generates incredible profit, it comes at a cost. If the Trickster is linked to a murder, so is she. Even if there is no evidence. Even if it’s just rumors. It’s her life on the line. Her entire career. She could never produce music again. And the worst part is… it's her own fault. She knows better than to trust someone in this industry.  <br><br>She needs to get answers, before it is too late. Whatever the Trickster is doing at night, she must find out. Her doubts won’t be quieted until she knows for certain.

                    Text: Yun-Jin leaves her security detail behind during the Trickster's rehearsal. What she is up to is not strictly legal, after all. <br><br>She shows her VIP badge at the doorman and enters the Trickster's changing room. Perhaps she could find something in here that could be a clue as to what the Trickster is up to. Amidst the flamboyant costumes, she looks for a clue: receipts, notes, pictures. All she finds is a gym bag. <br><br>Inside lies a water bottle, a few t-shirts, and his wallet. No bills or anything of interest in his wallet… except for his hotel room keycard. Perhaps she is looking in the wrong place. Someone chatting loudly on the side of the door alerts her. She snatches the hotel keycard and zips up the bag just as the Trickster's assistant walks in. <br><br>Yun-Jin quells her thudding heart and keeps her expression impassive as she walks out. Whatever the assistant saw, she will not dare mention it, at least not to anyone who matters. <br><br>Yun-Jin only pauses when she reaches the Trickster's hotel room, keycard in hand. If she does this, there is no turning back. Yet if the Trickster is hiding something, she needs to know what it is, before everyone else does. Before it ruins her life. There can be no doubts. Yun-Jin pushes the door open. <br><br><b>***</b><br><br>The Trickster's room is tidy. Almost as if he barely spends time here. She goes through his luggage. A pile of odd clothes. All-black hoodies and sweatpants. A black facemask. Clothes she's never seen him wear on tour. <br><br>A tap on the door.<br><br>Room service. Yun-Jin drops the facemask. Come back later. <br><br>She finds nothing odd in the room, except for a rare, top-of-the-line sampler on his bedside table. Intrigued, she presses play. A series of loud, violent screams fill the room. The screeches sound… genuine. Samples from a horror film? <br><br>Yet she cannot fully shake her initial, disturbing thought. What if it is… genuine? <br><br>What she finds next only enhances her discomfort. A sharpening kit for knives. Wet stones and cleaning products. A whole collection of sharpeners. <br><br>A past conversation overheard at the recording studio replays in her mind. Lucas, the young artist, introducing himself to the Trickster, asking about the flamboyant knife in his hands. The Trickster replying that he always keeps a blade on him. <br><br>Yun-Jin picks up a wet stone. Why sharpen a stage prop? Sure, the Trickster used real knives to do stunt work as a kid, but it is no longer necessary. This obsession with knives is not just for show. And what is the point of sharpening a knife if it's not to use it? She shudders. <br><br>Another noise at the door. Yun-Jin puts down the wet stone. <br><br> I said come back la--<br><br>Trickster walks into the room, catching her off guard. Her eyes meet his. <br><br>He is just the awkward kid I signed years ago. I will not let him drag me down. <br><br>His outrage meets her fury. Yun-Jin picks up the sampler. <br><br>Where the hell do you wander off at night? And what is this twisted horror bullshit? What if the media got ahold of it? Your career would be over. <br><br>Trickster sighs and admits that after the death of NO SPIN, his mind drifted to a dark place. He rarely talks about their death, and she can tell why. That day still haunts her dreams. Time passes, but guilt remains. <br><br>Yun-Jin spots his phone on the table. <br><br>Grab a drink from the mini bar, Trickster. Today's rehearsal is canceled. <br><br>She keeps the sampler and reminds him to stay on hotel grounds until the concert. He nods in agreement. <br><br>Good. For her ploy to work, he must think she trusts him.

                    Text: Yun-Jin looks out from her hotel room. Outside the downpour is relentless, causing flash floods in parts of the city. She calls her staff. No matter how bad the storm is, the show must go on. <br><br>Yet the weather is not to blame for the growing apprehension in the pit of her stomach. There is something off about the Trickster, a hunch she can no longer ignore, no matter how profitable he is. While he might seem sincere, years in the business have taught her that she cannot trust anyone.  <br><br> Yun-Jin grabs her phone and activates the GPS tracker on the Trickster's company phone. His location appears as a blue dot on the huge map of Rio. Her gut feeling is right. He is no longer on the hotel premises. <br><br>The chase is on. Time to teach the Trickster a new trick. <br><br>Yun-Jin slows down near Trickster's location. As she approaches, a grey sedan suddenly speeds off. She checks her phone. The blue dot is getting farther away on the map. Trickster must be in the car that just took off. <br><br>Yun-Jin stomps on the accelerator and speeds off. After a few turns she catches up with the sedan, which makes a sharp right. Yun-Jin follows, yanking the steering wheel while stomping on the breaks. Her car drifts into the turn, gliding towards a wretched, narrow alley. <br><br>The sedan accelerates and swerves left, entering a narrow street. Yun-Jin repeats her maneuver and drifts left, but the wheels hydroplane on the puddled asphalt, and the car spirals out of control. <br><br>A thundering crash. Yun-Jin's head is propelled onto the steering wheel. A flash of white light. Then a burning pain follows, coursing down her body from her neck to her lower back. <br><br><b>***</b><br><br> Yun-Jin coughs and gasps at the pain. For a moment, all she can do is breathe. When she exhales, the pain lessens slightly. Loud rock is blaring on the radio. It’s so loud. She reaches forward and turns it off absentmindedly. A spot above her left brow is burning. She touches her forehead softly and winces. A drop of blood drips down her finger.<br><br>The windshield is cracked on the passenger side. Yun-Jin moves slowly, carefully leaning over. <br><br>It's OK. Everything is OK. I'm OK. <br><br>She looks out. The car crashed into a streetlamp on the passenger side. This could have been much worse. <br><br>A familiar ding interrupts her thoughts. Her phone. Yun-Jin slowly leans forward, her hand searching under her seat. She grabs her phone and unlocks the screen. A text message from the Trickster: HELP.<br><br>Why would he ask for her help… unless she missed something? Unless… the Trickster is not the one she is chasing. <br><br>Yun-Jin's heart skips a beat. The death threat. The Trickster's number one fan. Perhaps the crazed fan found out about the Trickster's nightly escapades and decided to strike. Kidnappings go hand-in-hand with death threats after all. <br><br>She lets out a curse. In her rush to chase the Trickster, she left her bodyguard behind. If anything happens to the Trickster, Ji-Woon, and she was too blind to stop it… No. She has enough guilt on her conscience already. <br><br>Yun-Jin re-adjusts her seatbelt. She turns on the ignition and the engine coughs in response. She grits her teeth and tries again. <br><br>It won't be like the fire… I won't give up on him. <br><br>She turns on the ignition again. And again. On the third try, the engine revs back to life. She puts her phone back on the dashboard and follows the blue dot.

The parking lot is filled with broken-down cars. Yun-Jin uses her cell phone's flashlight to find the grey sedan. As thunder rumbles, her phone illuminates a bloodied handprint on a car window. She rushes to the door and peeks inside. A sudden blur of motion. She pulls the door open. <br><br>A rat skitters out of the car.

                    Text: Close call today. Came in contact with the arachnas while testing multiple versions of the toxin. The doctor saw them coming through the window and ordered me to leave everything behind. She said we would return to the lab when the arachnas were gone and it was safe again. We still haven’t found a toxin deadly enough to eliminate these horrible creatures, but I feel we’re close. Very close. If we had a sense of their origins, it would help. As it stands, we still don’t know where they came from or what they want. All we know is the attacks started at the same time.  What makes our investigation more challenging is the fact that their DNA is unlike anything we’ve ever encountered. It’s as though… it’s as though they came from another place…

                    Text: Returned to the make-shift lab today and found dozens of people wrapped in silk hanging from the ceiling. Blood dripped in sticky pools right under them. I tried to look away as I grabbed the crate of toxins that we had left behind. But as I carried the crate into the corridor, I couldn’t help but notice in the corner of my eye that one of those pods started to move. I forced myself to look and very quickly realized that these pods weren’t filled with food but with something else. It was clear that something was moving and growing inside the cocoon. Something was feeding off the dripping body parts that had been wrapped with it. The groaning creature inside the cocoon struggled to break free, and I instantly rushed out of the lab as fast as my trembling legs could take me. The last thing I wanted was to confront the latest arachna evolution. The arachnas mutate faster than we kill them, and finding the right toxin is our only chance at survival. Let’s hope the doctor and I do so before it’s too late.

                    Text: Dr. Morell and I worked tirelessly for three days and found a candidate for mass production. Toxin HJ7 killed 100 percent of arachna specimens in less than a minute. One dose and the creatures disintegrated into a thick puddle of bubbling, black tar which very quickly evaporated into a poisonous mist that killed the other arachnas we held in captivity for our experiments.  I think both the doctor and I were shocked and amazed at the result. While it is true that we might not know where these monsters came from, we now have a way to eliminate them.  The doctor and I are currently looking for ways to get samples of the toxin to other survivors.  The office worker turned cook volunteered, but Dr. Morell chose a few other unlikely candidates. She says it’s because he has a track record of messing up his assignments. Personally, I think that’s just an excuse, and the truth is… she’ll miss his cooking… his pizza. Helps her remember better days before the invasion. Helps us all remember better days, I suppose.

                    Title: Chamber of Blood. The Tale that Follows.
                    Text: Constable Duncan J. Smith said thousands of dogs haunted him wherever he went, but no one else saw them. To get away from the dogs he would hide in the crawl space underneath his cabin, or he would hide in the shed where he kept his snowmobile, or sometimes he would escape to the glaciers and hide in the ice caves where he prayed for the howling and the yelping and the whimpering to stop. But the howling and the yelping and the whimpering never stopped, and no matter where he hid, the dogs always found him.  

The first day Duncan saw the dogs was the day he started questioning his job. Or rather, it was the day he started questioning the law and what he was doing with the law. There was something about legally destroying dogs that felt off… that felt… wrong… something that tugged at his heart and wouldn’t let go… something telling him that he needed to get out of the cold, lonely Arctic Archipelago before it was too late—if it wasn’t already too late.  

For Duncan, it was the first time in his career as a police officer that he realized that the law wasn’t always the glorified tool for civilization he had imagined it to be. Sometimes the law was something else.  Something blunt. Something hard.  Something almost like a gavel… a gavel of destruction or oppression or perhaps both—destruction and oppression.  

Truth is, Duncan wasn’t sure what he was thinking anymore. He was exhausted, and the dogs… well… the dogs just wouldn’t leave him be, and all he wanted to do was return home and farm. He liked working on the farm. Things were simpler on the farm. But here, up north, things were more complicated, and Duncan couldn’t help but think about the law.  

About the gavel.  

And the last thing Duncan wanted to do was wield that gavel against anyone. And yet—to his everlasting regret—he had used it against the dogs.  

And though he had done everything by the book… and though the law said he had committed no crime… his heart continually testified to the opposite.   

To be sure, Duncan had led countless dogs to the bay, where he had shot them like vermin in front of their owners. And it was only when he was alone and surrounded by their ghosts that he would admit to himself that what he had done didn’t feel so right and that maybe… just maybe… these dogs weren’t the dangerous beasts or the diseased rats his captain had made them out to be. They were… well… they were something else.   

They were friends.  

They were family members.  

They played with children, entertained them and kept them safe. They warned against approaching wolves and polar bears, and even snowstorms. And more than anything they made sure no hunter ever got lost in a blizzard unlike those unreliable ‘iron dogs’ or snowmobiles that broke down in the middle of nowhere and left a trail of black smoke across the cold, white, endless expanse. No ‘iron dog’ ever led someone out of a blizzard. The same… well… the same could not be said of the dogs…  

…the dogs he had so heartlessly destroyed.  

But in those days—when the production of the first commercial ‘iron dog’ commenced—there weren’t many challenges to the law, and so Duncan certainly tried to convince himself that he was doing the good and lawful thing for everyone.  

And while it’s true that the mind might not make the difference between what is right and what is lawful, the heart certainly does.   

The heart—it is often said—doesn’t lie.  

Nonetheless, Duncan found ways to trick himself and ignore the appeals of his heart. He told himself these dogs weren’t like other dogs, and he actually believed his lie for a few months. But as time wore on, he very quickly realized that these dogs were… well… like the dogs he had known back home.  

Knowing this made it harder and harder for him to fall asleep, and soon he started to hallucinate and see all the dogs he had shot.  

At first it was just one. Then it was two. Then a dozen. Then a dozen became a hundred. And a hundred became a thousand. A thousand dead dogs howled and stared at Duncan every night, preventing him from sleeping, from dreaming, from thinking—preventing him from living the life he had once known.    

Everywhere Duncan went, there they were, the dogs, looking at him with those eyes—those pleading, confused eyes, wondering what they had done wrong, or how they had failed their family and friends to deserve such a cold and indifferent end.  

Truth is, Duncan couldn’t escape those ghosts any more than a dog could escape its own tail. Wherever he went, there they were, following him, reminding him of all the lives he had disrupted and destroyed with… well… with that gavel.  

One evening, Duncan sat in bed, holding his aching head in his hands, staring at the decaying dogs sitting all around him. They watched him closely as he tried to fall asleep and howled or barked every time his eyelids began to slip. Trembling with fear and exhaustion, Duncan murmured he had done nothing wrong and that he had acted in accordance with the law and that they should just leave him alone. But— 

The dogs wouldn’t leave him alone. They just stared at him in silence with those eyes—eyes that reminded him of his own dog.   

Anguished, Duncan lurched from his bed, screaming at the dogs, telling them he needed to sleep and that he wasn’t going to feel guilty for doing his damn job! He outright refused to apologize or feel guilty for doing what the law required him to do. What the law said he had to do!  

The dogs suddenly stirred anxiously about the cabin with their heads down and tails between their legs. Duncan’s screams grew louder and louder, and one by one, the dogs whimpered and whined for their lives like they had done when they had been destroyed. Then—just like that—they vanished into thin air as though Duncan had finally scared them away.   

When Duncan realized the dogs were gone, he collapsed into his bed and prayed that they should finally leave him alone. He just wanted his life back, for the dogs had robbed him of his strength and freedom and even his sense of identity as a morally upright officer of the law.   

That night, a storm picked up and blew all around his small cabin. Feeling a chill seep through his bones, Duncan rose from the bed, and he made a small fire in the iron stove as he remembered his first and only dog, Buster, a plump Yellow Labrador Retriever with a black snout.  

Smartest, kindest and warmest dog he had ever known.   

To Duncan, Buster was more than just a dog. He was his guardian, his confidant, his best friend. He was the brother he never had. He caught rodents, guarded against coyotes and drove cattle on the farm. His father used to say a good dog was worth two or three farm-hands, and Buster was certainly worth four. Thinking about it now, he was glad that no one ever used the law against Buster, or any other dog in his town for that matter.  

To be sure, Buster wasn’t as big or strong as these Arctic dogs, but he was quite the hunter and had once even saved him from a wolverine. But what Duncan remembered most was that Buster used to curl up in bed with him to calm his anxious heart and help him drift away to sleep.   

And now Duncan longed for nothing more than the undisturbed, soundless sleep of youth.  And as he longed for sleep, the wind blew harder and fiercer through the cracks of his cabin. The fire flared, flickered and snapped, casting violent shadows that seemed to tell stories.   

Duncan rubbed his eyes to make the hallucinations go away. But wherever he looked the shadows took the form of officers and hunters shooting at confused and frightened dogs as a thick and unnatural black smoke began to fill the cabin.  

Duncan tried to pinch himself awake. But when he realized he wasn’t asleep, he quickly shut his eyes and once again begged for the dogs to just leave him alone.  

He wanted one night of rest. Just one night! His brain reeled with despair, and he began to hear the warped voice of his captain laughing at him, shouting at him, tormenting him, telling him the dogs were dangerous… aggressive… a definite blight on their future plans.  

Duncan felt madness clutching at the seams of his soul. He screamed that these were lies! All of them!  And when he opened his eyes again, the black smoke was gone, and the shadows were once again meaningless shapes flickering about the cabin.   

But just as Duncan sighed his relief, he heard a sound.  

A gentle, scratching sound. At the door. Then he heard a bark that sounded vaguely familiar. The bark came again and again and it sounded like— 

Buster.  

Duncan narrowed his gaze and cautiously approached the thick, wooden door. The scratching stopped just as he placed his hand on the doorknob. He stood in silence for a long, tense moment. When the scratching came again, he quickly opened the door and caught a fleeting glimpse of yellow fur disappearing beyond thick sheets of falling snow.   

Exhausted and confused, Duncan rushed into the churning storm in his undergarments and slippers, yelling for Buster to wait for him. Then he stopped suddenly when he realized he was being irrational. His tired mind was playing tricks on him.  

Buster had been dead for over twenty years. He had been hit by a car. And for a fleeting moment, Duncan remembered holding his paw on the side of the road, calming him down as his life slowly seeped away. He had never cried so much in his life. There was no possible way Buster could still be with him.  

Covered in snow, Duncan told himself the solitude was getting to him and that he just needed one night of undisturbed sleep. He turned back toward the cabin. But as he turned, he realized…  

…he was lost.  

He couldn’t see an inch in front of him in any direction.  Cold and panic swept over him at once.  He turned and turned as the wind howled and shrieked and whimpered. In the raging blizzard, he could only make out— 

Dogs.  

Ghostly dogs. Dead and decaying dogs. Thousands of them. Running around him. Growling. Howling. Barking. Confusing him.  

Duncan shouted for them to stop, and he tried to scare them off as he had done before. But the dogs grew faster and fiercer as though they were one with the storm.  

Duncan fell to his knees and felt the cold bite all over his trembling body. His face twisted in terror as each dog seemed to pounce out of the storm to take its turn chomping down on him with cold, indifferent teeth. He collapsed to his side in agony. A terrible numbness crept over him, not so much from the cold but the memory of hurting all those poor dogs. He begged for them to stop, and then he did what he had never done before.  

He confessed his shame and begged for forgiveness.   

At once, the dogs froze and stared at him with eyes that seemed to look straight into his heart.    

Duncan choked out that he was sorry, that he was truly sorry, and that even though he had done everything by the book, he had done everything wrong. He had done them wrong. He had done their families wrong. And he had done himself wrong.  

And as he emptied his heart, he heard a familiar bark as Buster suddenly emerged from the ghostly pack and stood before him.   

The dogs looked at Buster, then Duncan, then Buster again. A wave of peace seemed to wash over them as they disappeared one by one and left Duncan with his guardian… his friend… his brother. And Buster curled down beside Duncan as his heart slowed to a stop, and the blinding, white storm swept his life away as it had done so many others.  

 

When Constable Duncan J. Smith didn’t show up at the station the next day, his fellow officers searched for him and found his frozen corpse not ten feet from his cabin. He was lying on his side with a peaceful expression on his face. One officer noticed that he had been running around in circles, while the others questioned why he had been foolish enough to leave his cabin in his undergarments in the middle of a snowstorm.  

The captain kneeled by Duncan’s frozen black and blue face and sighed.  Just as he ordered someone to cover the body, another officer panicked and rubbed his eyes, claiming he saw dogs all around him.  He stumbled back and screamed for the dogs to stay away from him. No one saw what he was seeing, and the captain told him to stop making jokes at Duncan’s expense. But the frantic officer shrieked in terror and swore that the dogs were real and that they were following him.

                    Text: Some civilizations collapse because they discover knowledge they aren’t mature enough to understand. Other civilizations collapse because of natural disasters. And yet other civilizations get a little push… a little nudge… over the cliff. I have studied the final days of countless worlds… been through the memories of so many survivors… and I can say that The Entity doesn’t just corrupt and consume a world… it somehow taps into our collective fears and has a little fun.  From what I’ve observed The Entity seems to take its time cherry-picking souls from a buffet of misery while contemplating a perfect design of destruction as though… as though an apocalypse was a kind of work of art… a kind of masterpiece. This I realize goes against everything I’ve learned about Ancients back home. But I cannot deny that all the stories and memories I’ve been examining suggest a voluntary and not involuntary will to create and destroy on the part of this Ancient. It’s all speculation at this point but the last realm that opened up in the basement allowed me to venture into Terra Arachna where I witnessed the fall of a world to massive, spider-like creatures—monsters that could have only come from The Entity. Not wanting any of those monsters escaping into the tower, I quickly etched a symbol into the basement door to make the realm disappear. Then, just to be certain, I opened the door and all that was left of the apocalypse was a small, empty room covered in dust. But, as I examined the room, I thought I heard a kind of chittering sound in the corridors. I swallowed a growing lump in my throat and cautiously searched the tower to make sure nothing had escaped. I didn’t find anything inside, but noises outside continue to disturb my sleep, and I’m sure I’ve seen things moving in the fog.

                    Text: <b>Stories from the Witch Café. The Forever Horror.</b> Welcome one, welcome all, to the Moonstone! Please enjoy today's special, Pumpkin Ghoul Pie with, may I suggest, a cup of Franken Spice Coffee while I do my best to entertain you with tonight's story. This one comes from a challenge I received from friends to tell a scary story that could go on forever. I'm not sure if it's as scary as it's gross, but it's certainly fitting for Halloween and it takes place in Medieval, Europe.  I call this one, Tiny Awful Things, but my friends are telling me I should probably call it, The Forever Horror. Have a listen and let's discuss afterwards.<br><br>There was no doubt: Lucian was a coward. He was strong and clever and fast, but a coward, nevertheless. That's what made being drafted into the king's army and marched into battle all the worse. Not wanting to put himself in harm's way, Lucian thought of a clever plan to avoid injury or even death. <br><br>As soon as the horns blared and the infantry charged into the fray, Lucian executed his cowardly plan. He let loose a war-cry like none other, rushed forward with his sword raised, then, when no one was looking, when he heard the clash of iron and the agonizing screams of dying soldiers, he made himself tumble to the ground where he played dead and hoped for the best.<br><br>Lucian was so scared that despite the stink of rotting humanity he kept his eyes closed for several days until he felt someone or something tapping his shoulder. When he opened his eyes, he found himself staring up at a man in dark robes, holding a bloody scythe. <br><br>Lucian was staring at Death. <br><br>Or, at least, that's what he thought. <br><br>Actually, it wasn't Death at all, but a lower dimensional demon making the rounds, making mischief, pretending to be Death, looking for someone, anyone, to torment. And if you know anything about lower dimensional demons you know that they absolutely delight in tormenting cowards—cowards and narcissists. <br><br>And so, this lower dimensional demon stared at Lucian with glowing red eyes and told him his time had come and asked if he had any last requests.  Lucian, of course, extended a trembling hand and begged for his life. As the demon laughed and shook its ugly head, a thought came to Lucian, and he quickly begged for one last meal. <br><br>The demon stepped back, smiled, and said he would entertain his last request. He told him he would allow him to live for as much time it would take for him to fill his belly with whatever he could find on this battlefield… no… not battlefield… buffet… this buffet of death. <br><br>Lucian didn't know what to do. He didn't know what to eat. He wasn't a cannibal, and he certainly didn't want to commit any kind of sin before dying. He was about to surrender to his fate when he felt something squirm by his hand. He looked down and that's when he saw the… tiny, awful things… squirming out of the bloated belly of a corpse… falling on his hand. <br><br>Desperate, Lucian did the unthinkable. With a miserable sigh, he plunged his hand into the rotting belly, felt around the stinking, oozing innards and soon pulled out a dangling white maggot. <br><br>Swallowing a thickness in his throat, he held the tiny, awful thing up in the moonlight, then opened his mouth and let the maggot plop onto his tongue.  
The demon winced in disgust, laughed in disbelief, then said some words in a strange, unknown language. <br><br>Lucian didn't understand any of it, but he thought he might have been cursed as he strangely began to feel a great insatiable hunger for maggots.  More than this, he even began savoring them as one might savor a fine wine or coffee, enjoying, to his disbelief, the aftertaste. <br><br>I guess we can say that as a coffee bean soaks up the essence of the tree and land it grows upon, a maggot soaks up the essence of the corpse it feeds upon. <br><br>The demon smiled at Lucian as he desperately tried to delay the inevitable. When Lucian finally finished savoring the maggot, the demon told him his time was up. <br><br>But Lucian shook his head and said his belly wasn't full yet. Then he approached a corpse that had been crushed by a club.  Blood and gore spilled out of the eye sockets like spaghetti and meatballs. And there in the spaghetti and meatballs tiny, awful things squirmed. Lucian plucked another maggot and plopped it onto his greedy, salivating, tongue. <br><br>Robust. Earthy. Slimy. A velvety maggot that bursts with herbal notes and soothes with its fresh and bold character. <br><br>The demon smiled at the coward and said his time was up. <br><br>But Lucian shook his head and said his belly wasn't full yet. Then he approached a corpse that had been diced into small pieces by an ax. Chunks of bone and intestine festered in pools of blood like stew. And there in the stew tiny, awful things squirmed. Lucian plucked another maggot and plopped it onto his tongue. <br><br>Bold, yet fruity. Chewy. A sweet maggot with delicate hints of citrus. <br><br>The demon smiled at the coward and said his time was up. <br><br>Lucian shook his head and said his belly wasn't full yet. Then he approached a corpse that had been trampled by horses and marching soldiers. Pieces of skull and brain fermented in bile and blood like a delicious dipping sauce for veggies. And there in the dipping sauce tiny, awful things squirmed. Lucian plucked another maggot and plopped it onto his tongue. <br><br>Herbal. Intense. Mushy. A full-bodied maggot rich in flavor. <br><br>The demon smiled at the coward and said his time was up…and as you can imagine the story goes on and on cause the demon enjoyed watching this coward grovel like a maggot for his life. And since it goes on and on, I would appreciate some help telling it… at least until we run out of tiny, awful things. <br><br>Please pass this bowl of putrid guts and gore around the Moonstone. I invite you to reach inside and choose a tiny, awful thing to savor. <br><br>Please feel free to describe its flavors and let's not spare any gory, juicy, mushy details. <br><br>Okay, okay. I confess… They aren't real maggots, but slimy, sugary things soaking in warm brandy and pumpkin guts… but let's stick our hands in anyway and have a little fun to help us get into the spirit of Halloween.

                    Title: The Bell from Hell
                    Text: <b>Stories from the Witch Café. The Bell from Hell.</b> Welcome one, welcome all, to the only place in town to get a story and a coffee. I can tell you where the coffee comes from, but please don't ask me where the stories and characters come from cause I basically have no clue. Some say it's the aroma of freshly brewed coffee that inspires me. Others say I'm able to tap into the endless memory streams pouring out of the infinite kettle that is the multiverse. I think it's a little bit of both. This one comes from the grains I observed at the bottom of my espresso cup a few days ago. It kind of resembled a bell… and so I'm calling this one… The Bell from Hell. <br><br>Toby and his sister Tina were always up to no good, and this time they snuck into the old, overgrown junkyard that many claimed was haunted. Despite the rumors, the teens played in the rusty wrecks, honking horns, kicking windshields, and, of course, scaring each other to hell. <br><br>'It's fun here!'' Toby said. <br><br>'It is!'' Tina agreed. <br><br>As the night wore on Toby hid in the trunk of an old sedan with the intention of scaring his sister. But Tina followed a trail he unwittingly left and— <br><br>RRRAAH! <br><br>Scared him instead! <br><br>Toby cursed, and Tina ran off promising she would get him, again. She quickly rushed to the old compactor and hid in a half-squashed station wagon filled with a strange, black fog. That's odd, she thought, and didn't think any more of it. <br><br>But she probably should have thought a little more of it since strange, black fog isn't exactly an omen as you know from my previous stories.  Anyhow, Tina waited patiently in the backseat. When an hour passed, she began to worry. Slowly, she craned her head to peak out the window when—<br><br>RRRAAH! <br><br>Toby slammed the station! <br><br>Tina nearly jumped out of her skin, hitting her head against the ceiling of the half-crumpled car. Toby couldn't help but laugh, and as he laughed, he looked down into the churning, black fog and saw—<br><br>A bell. <br><br>A strange-looking, iron bell unlike any bell he had ever seen before. <br><br>''Will you look at this, '' he said, holding up the bell, examining the craftsmanship. Then he grabbed a stick from the ground and clanged the bell stupidly. <br><br>CLANG. CLANG. CLANG. <br><br>The ominous ring echoed through the abandoned junkyard as the black fog thickened and swirled around them. But before they could say anything about the strange fog—<br><br>The compactor came to life! <br><br>WHIRRRRRR! <br><br>Tina felt her heart fall into the pit of her stomach, and she screamed in horror! <br><br>Toby dropped the bell, grabbed her hands and yanked her out just in time. Breathlessly, they watched the station wagon as it creaked and groaned and shattered into scrap. <br><br>There was a long, tense silence as they wondered what had given sudden power to the otherwise rusted and broken compactor. Just then, the bell rang, again. This time behind them. Tina exchanged a look with Toby and swallowed a growing thickness in her throat. They turned slowly to face—<br><br>Nothing. <br><br>Absolutely, nothing. <br><br>Nothing but the swirling fog. <br><br>It was probably just their imaginations. <br><br>Or was it… <br><br>For just as they released a collective sigh, the bell rang once again, and something suddenly materialized out of the fog. Within moments, they were face to face with a—<br><br>Wraith! <br><br>The Wraith instantly grabbed Toby by the neck with one arm and lifted him high in the silvery moonlight, his feet dangling, his arms flailing, his lips quivering with fear. <br><br>Tina gasped and stumbled back to her haunches. The Wraith smashed Toby against the ground with a powerful thud. He raised a rusted, wheel wrench and proceeded to bludgeon his head to scrap, blood and gore splattering everywhere. <br><br>Then the Wraith turned to face Tina with his creepy bell and dead eyes. Covered in her brother's warm blood, Tina screamed until her lungs gave out and waited… for the bell to toll. <br><br>Now what the siblings didn't realize was that they had entered a kind of dimensional pocket that had brought them to another world.  See, there are these pockets or holes in the world that lead to all kinds of dark places… places that defy reality… dark places that make all our combined depictions of hell seem like a flower garden.  But that's another story for another dark and creepy night. Let's just say that for Toby and Tina death was not an escape.

                    Title: Wrath of the Killer Pumpkins 
                    Text: <b>Stories from the Witch Café. Wrath of the Killer Pumpkins.</b> Welcome one, welcome all, to the Moonstone Café!  Tonight, seeing as we just made a batch of Pumpkin Spice Cheesecake to go with our famous Halloween Latte, I thought a story about pumpkins might be fitting. This story was told long ago in a village that once stood very close to where we all stand now, and I call this one, Wrath of the Killer Pumpkins.<br><br>The widow's name was Ulla and more than anything she wanted to win the annual pumpkin festival. Not just for the prize money, but to impress her six-year-old daughter, Rebecca, who loved everything about pumpkins. Their texture. Their shape. Their color. Their smell. Everything.<br><br>But Ulla's pumpkins were nothing compared to her neighbor's pumpkins. Her neighbor Mona won the pumpkin festival every year, and she seemed to have a secret for growing perfect pumpkins. <br><br>That's not to say, Ulla's pumpkins were bad. They weren't. They just weren't very special. At best, they had been described by the great pumpkin judges as average. Average height.  Average width. Average color.  Average smell. Average.  
And average didn't win awards. <br><br>Well, not wanting to be average anymore, Ulla decided she needed to know Mona's secret. So, one morning she waited until Mona left for the market, and when she knew the coast was clear, she did the unthinkable. She snuck into her house. <br><br>To Ulla's amazement the kitchen was filled with glass jars containing pumpkin seeds of every variety. Each jar had a label that included a name, instructions, and some very peculiar symbols.   
Reading the labels, Ulla felt a cold shiver run through her body. She couldn't make sense of the names or symbols and for a moment, just a moment, she suspected witchcraft. <br><br>Part of her wanted to run, but the other part—the part that hated to lose—wanted a little help, a little boost, a fighting chance to win the festival and make her daughter proud. <br><br>Ignoring her better instinct to run, Ulla found a jar labeled: Mortafykuss Cucurruss. She scrutinized the label and read that these seeds would produce the biggest and brightest pumpkins but that they were still quite unstable. The seeds were unstable. Ulla winced, and she had no idea what that meant or how pumpkin seeds could be unstable. She continued to read a warning—<br><br>No blood. Especially at night. <br><br>She laughed out loud. Who in their right mind would feed a plant blood? Who would heed such a warning? And for a moment she really thought that maybe, just maybe, Mona was a witch, a powerful witch who could defy nature and modify and mutate seeds. <br><br>Despite the creepy warnings, Ulla borrowed one seed--just one-- from the Mortafykuss Cucurruss jar, convincing herself that she would give Mona back a seed from her winning pumpkin. With that promise, she convinced herself she wasn't stealing, and she quickly returned to her small, humble farm. <br><br>No sooner did Ulla return home than she planted the seed in her garden. To her amazement there was a visible pumpkin growing the very next day, and every day after that more pumpkins appeared linked to a thorny, green vine unlike anything she had ever seen before. <br><br>Well, to be sure, Rebecca jumped up and down with joy at the sight of the massive pumpkins. She couldn't stop hugging and measuring and sniffing the pumpkins. <br><br>When the time came, Ulla told Rebecca to choose a pumpkin for the festival, and as she selected the choicest pumpkin from the patch, she got so excited that she tumbled into the thick, green vines and cut herself against the thorns. The vines and pumpkins trembled momentarily with sudden life. <br><br>Ulla dismissed the sudden movement as the wind and proceeded to dress her daughter's wounds. Then she placed the chosen pumpkin on a wheelbarrow and pushed it to the market to face the judges of the great, big pumpkin festival. <br><br>It didn't take long to declare Ulla the winner. And Rebecca jumped up and down, and she screamed and celebrated that they had finally won the festival. <br><br>Ulla reveled in her daughter's joy and felt a great surge of pride. <br><br>But that joy was short-lived when Mona suddenly emerged from the crowd admiring the winning pumpkin and sniffing it as though searching for a signature scent. A tell-tale. Proof that Ulla had stolen one of her seeds. Then she put her ear to the pumpkin and locked eyes with Ulla. For a moment, it seemed as though she wanted to say something. But then, Mona smiled, gave the pumpkin a gentle caress, and walked away. <br><br>Ulla watched Mona until she disappeared, and she told herself she would gut her winning pumpkin and return a seed back to Mona just as soon as she returned home. <br><br>And so, with exhausted arms, Ulla wheelbarrowed her pumpkin down the dirt road with her daughter singing and skipping behind her in the moonlight. Caught up in the euphoria of winning, Ulla tried to skip with her daughter, but she missed a beat and twisted her foot on a stone. <br><br>Ulla stumbled forward, lost control of the wheelbarrow and the great, big pumpkin tumbled out, smashing against a massive stone. <br><br>Suddenly, mother and daughter froze in terror! <br><br>Thick, orange liquid like blood poured out of the busted pumpkin. Through the cracks they could see something moving… something… breathing… <br><br>Ulla approached the pumpkin slowly. She hesitated, then placed her fingers in the pulpy crack and pulled and pulled and—<br><br>WHAAAAH! <br><br>A pumpkin baby burst out! <br><br>And attached itself to her face! <br><br>Pulp dripping down her face and back, Ulla ripped the pumpkin baby off her face and smashed it repeatedly against the ground as it wailed and screamed and finally died. Then she dropped the limp, pulpy corpse in the grass and watched it melt into a thick, orange puddle of steaming, pumpkin puss. <br><br>Ulla grabbed her daughter by the hand and rushed home. But when they reached home… the whole farm had been overrun by gigantic, bright orange pumpkins and thick vines with thorns like knives. <br><br>Wanting to burn the pumpkin patch down, Ulla held her daughter close, and she led her to the shed as the vines trembled, slithered and brushed by their feet. Then, all at once, the vines coiled around their ankles and—<br><br>WHAAAAP! <br><br>Mother and daughter hit the ground as throbbing vines wrapped around them like hungry snakes. <br><br>Ulla stared in horror as massive pumpkins seemed to suddenly hatch like giant orange eggs in the moonlight. From those pumpkins came creatures staggering on two legs with long, clumsy vines for arms. <br><br>And as these killer pumpkins closed in on Ulla, she noticed they had orange and green skin and thick thorns for feet, and… the faces… they… resembled… her daughter. <br><br>Before she could make sense of what she was seeing, an evil vine coiled around her neck and head and thirsty thorns pierced her skin and gorged on her blood as hundreds of newborn pumpkin monsters wailed at the moon and a cold darkness swept over her. <br><br>As for the younglings… they grew and multiplied and went on a murderous rampage throughout the town. But, rest assured, they were finally stopped by a few good witches with some pretty powerful spells. But that's another story for another dark and creepy night. Let's just agree that we shouldn't mess around with pumpkin seeds and that we prefer to eat our pumpkins than be eaten by them.
