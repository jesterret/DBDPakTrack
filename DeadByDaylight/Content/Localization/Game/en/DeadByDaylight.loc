	Ace Visconti is one charming guy. With his sharp Italian looks, grey-streaked hair and silver tongue, he could pass for an aging 50's movie star. <br><br>His heart has always belonged to the cards. From his roots as a poor boy in Argentina, he gamed, scammed, seduced and smooth-talked his way to a life of luxury as a high roller in the land of opportunity. Despite money always having a way of slipping through his fingers, Ace always figured he could win more. <br><br>He never fulfilled that ambition; eventually he racked up too many debts with the wrong kind of people. And when they finally came to collect, Ace was nowhere to be found. No one knew who tipped him off or where he fled to, but anyone who knew Ace Visconti can agree on one thing. He will survive: against all odds.
	As soon as Anna was able to walk, her mother started teaching her how to survive a harsh, solitary life in the northern woods. Living in such an extremely remote and dangerous area required skill and resilience. When sunlight became too dim for productive activities, they would take refuge in their house, a sturdy old cabin constructed to resist the toughest winters. Close to the hearth	It took two tours in Vietnam, a handful of medals, a knee full of shrapnel, and an honorable discharge to get William "Bill" Overbeck to stop fighting and try to live a peaceful life. He hated it. <br><br>After decades spent drifting aimlessly through dead end jobs, Bill went in for a routine surgery and woke up to find the world he knew was gone. A plague was turning normal people into mindless killing machines. Naturally, the first thing he did was fight his way home and put on his uniform. Making his way through rural ghost towns and pitch-black forests, he found other Survivors, and together they fled from the infected hordes. <br><br>In the end, Bill sacrificed himself to ensure their safety. His body was never found. Bill was left for dead. No one knows that he still has the only thing he ever wanted: an enemy to fight.

The people of the village were kind, and the elders helped settle their disputes and keep the old traditions alive. Lisa was particularly fond of the charms they taught her to draw for safety and good fortune. One night, as she was walking home through the woods, a terrible storm struck without warning. In the slick wet darkness, she lost her footing and struck her head. Slipping in and out of consciousness, she watched dark shapes approach between the trees. Soon they were close enough for her to make out their evil, hungry grins.<br><br>They kept her chained to the wall in a flooded cellar. Through the gloom, she could see others, whose open wounds swarmed with flies. They did not survive long once the cannibals began carving bites from their bodies with their rusted blades, but somehow Lisa persisted. Starved and mutilated, her gaunt arms became loose in their shackles. She pulled, and the metal tore through skin and muscle until she was free. Her flesh oozed viscous yellow pus and bones were visible beneath gangrenous wounds. She could go no further. Delirious, she thought of home; she thought of the elders. She traced the symbols they had taught her. A dark hunger stirred inside her. It yearned for blood. She chose vengeance.<br>The police search eventually brought them to the old house in the swamp. Its inhabitants had been dismembered and devoured. The elders	The son of wealthy landowners Max and Evelyn Thompson, this unnamed boy was an unwanted child born to savage parents. Hideously disfigured, he was shut away from society. So ashamed they were of their son, they bricked him into a room and fed him through a hole in the wall. When the boy escaped, he took his revenge savagely and terribly, slaughtering the parents which had tortured him instead of raising him.<br><br>After the deed was done, he continued to live his life at the farm, taking out his deranged violence on the animals that were allowed to run free. As he finally broke free from his shackles, he ran through the cornfields, chasing and slaughtering whatever he could find. They never found the bodies of Max and Evelyn, but they did find tortured and disembowelled animals, all over the farm. Coldwind Farm was quickly settled and the land split up and sold off. There was never a buyer for the farmhouse. Perhaps it was the sound of the chainsaw you could hear throughout those hot summer nights.<br>

While growing up in Manchester, he demonstrated serious potential in both sports and academics, and with his family connections, all doors were open to him. He could have succeeded at anything, if it weren't for his combative nature. David lived for the adrenaline rush of a good fight and would go out of his way to get into one.<br><br>His robustness and athletic abilities led him to rugby, where he could cut loose and really cause a ruckus. King excelled and gained a reputation as a promising, if somewhat reckless, rookie. His meteoric rise came to an abrupt end when he lost his temper and assaulted a referee, earning himself a lifetime ban from the league and cutting short what most people assumed was going to be a long, successful career. King was unconcerned; money was no issue, so he took it as an early retirement and focused on other fun things to do.<br><br>Free from the constraints of a career and enabled by the wealth of his family, David King spent most of his time at the pub, drinking, watching games, and getting into fights. Some might say he was wasting his life away. Not many people knew that he was an occasional "debt collector" or that he fought in clandestine bare-knuckle fight clubs.<br><br>When David King stopped showing up at the pub, the few friends he still had were not surprised. They figured he had finally picked a fight with someone stronger than he was. In a way, they were right.

	In Dead by Daylight, you can take the role of an unstoppable killer and hunt 4 Survivors, or play as one of 4 Survivors and try to escape alive. Read this guide to learn the basics of the game.<br><br>The guide is divided into 3 sections: <b>The Game</b>, <b>The Killer</b> and <b>The Survivors</b>. Each section has information that will help you master whichever role you choose to play. 
	Dead by Daylight is an asymmetric game. Each side in the trial has certain advantages and disadvantages:<br><br><b>The Killer</b> is an unstoppable, solitary monster. Killers see the world from a first person perspective. They each have heightened senses, deadly weapons and a unique power that helps them locate, chase, injure, catch and hook Survivors.<br><br><b>The Survivors</b> are a team of 4. They can choose to cooperate or to look out for themselves. Though they are weak and vulnerable, Survivors can use their small size to quickly vault through windows, leap over pallets, or find hiding spots. The Survivors have a wide third person perspective which gives them an advantage in situational awareness.
	The two roles have very different goals.<br><br><b>The Survivors'</b> goal is to escape the trial alive. In order to do so, they must find and repair 5 generators. Once they are repaired, the generators power 2 exit gates. Each gate has a switch that must be held down for a short time before the gate will open and the Survivors can escape.<br><br><b>The Killer's</b> goal is to find and catch Survivors in order to hang them on sacrificial hooks to be consumed by The Entity.
	The Entity is the mighty, malevolent being that created the nightmare realm of trials in which the killers and Survivors are trapped.<br><br>Not much is known about The Entity, and it is rarely seen, except for when it manifests to claim its sacrificed Survivors. Some claim to have caught a glimpse of it in the deep, dark fog beyond the trial walls. It was probably just their eyes playing tricks on them.
	The location of the trial is chosen by The Entity. Players can influence The Entity's choice by burning certain offerings. <br><br>Trial locations have certain fixed landmarks, but elements such as player starting locations, generators, chests, totems and exits are placed according to The Entity's whims. Even the terrain itself shifts from trial to trial.  
	In Dead by Daylight, there are two distinct roles to play and multiple characters in each role to choose from.<br><br>Each killer has their own strengths, weaknesses and unique power, whereas Survivors initially vary only in their appearance. However, every killer and Survivor has 3 unique perks to unlock in their bloodweb which can eventually be taught to other characters.<br><br>Every character comes with its own way to play, progression path, loadout and customization options which to fit your tastes. Feel free to experiment!
	The loadout is where you equip your character for the next trial.<br><br><b>Survivors</b> can equip up to 1 item, 2 add-ons for their item, 4 perks and 1 offering.<br><br><b>Killers</b> can equip up to 2 add-ons for their power, 4 perks and 1 offering. The power of the killer is intrinsic to that killer and cannot be changed.<br><br>Loadout options are unlocked through the progression system called <b>The Bloodweb</b> with a currency called <b>Bloodpoints</b> which are explained later in this section of the guide.
	Survivors can equip themselves with a variety of useful items. There are items that can accelerate repairs, hinder the killer, heal oneself or even allow Survivors to escape the trial through a secret door. Survivors may equip one item per trial, and every item can be enhanced by equipping add-ons.<br><br>For more information on items, please see <i>"Items & Add-ons"</i> in <b>The Survivors</b> section of this guide.
	Each killer has a unique power that defines how they are played. Details about the killer's power can be found in the loadout, and it can be customized with add-ons. <b><b>The killer's identity is hidden in the lobby, so Survivors must adapt their strategies once they have discovered who they are facing in the trial.
	Offerings are selected in the loadout before the trial and are limited to 1 per player. <br><br>Offerings are burnt at the beginning of the trial in order to influence The Entity to alter how the game will be played.<br><br>Offerings can have various effects, such as increasing bloodpoint rewards, altering the moonlight, or changing the number of chests or sacrificial hooks in the trial. 
	Perks are extra abilities obtainable by killers and Survivors. They offer new ways to evade, hide, help others, attack, catch and kill, or improve existing abilities. Equip the perks that fit your preferred strategy and playstyle. <br><br>Perks are first found in the bloodweb at level I. They can be improved by collecting them multiple times in the bloodweb, up to level III. Progressing the bloodweb is the only way to unlock and improve perks. Depending on their bloodweb level, characters can equip up 4 perks in a trial.
	Every killer and Survivor has a set of 3 unique perks found in their bloodweb at levels <b>5</b>, <b>10</b> and <b>15</b>. By levelling up further, characters eventually master their unique perks and can teach them to other characters. These <b>Teachable Perks</b> and are found in the bloodweb at levels <b>30</b>, <b>35</b> and <b>40</b>.<br><br>Once a teachable perk is unlocked, the corresponding perk can appear on other characters' bloodwebs. Teachable perks can also be unlocked through the <b>Shrine of Secrets<b>.
	Bloodpoints are earned in trials and are used to unlock rewards in <b>The Bloodweb</b>.<br>Your performance in a trial determines the amount of bloodpoints you earn.<br><br><b>The Survivors</b> earn rewards in 4 categories: "<b>Survival</b>" for staying alive, "<b>Objectives</b>" for repairing generators and working towards escape, "<b>Boldness</b>" for interactions with the killer, and "<b>Altruism</b>" for helping other Survivors.<br><b>The Killer</b> has 4 score categories as well: "<b>Brutality</b>" for hurting Survivors and destroying objects, "<b>Hunter</b>" for finding, chasing and catching Survivors, "<b>Deviousness</b>" for clever use of their powers, and "<b>Sacrifice</b>" for their primary goal: hooking Survivors for the pleasure of The Entity.<br><br>Bloodpoints are added to your player profile and can be used to make progress on <b>any</b> character's bloodweb.
	The Bloodweb is a procedurally generated skill tree. It consists of interconnected nodes which can be unlocked to acquire items, add-ons, offerings, perks and more. You progress through the bloodweb by collecting and spending bloodpoints.<br><br>Each character has their own bloodweb which represents their level and general progress. Collecting all nodes on a bloodweb increases that character's level and generates a new, larger, bloodweb. At level <b>10</b>, The Entity awakens and begins to consume nodes on a character's bloodweb, so players must priorize what nodes they would like to reach before The Entity does. Though the maximum level is <b>50</b>, at this level players can continue to complete bloodwebs and generate new ones indefinitely. <br><br>At level <b>50</b>, a character is eligible for <b>prestige</b>.
	Status effects are positive or negative effects applied to Survivors and killers. Status effects are represented by icons on the right side of the screen.<br><br><b>Yellow</b> status icons indicate positive effects. <br><b>Red</b> status icons indicate negative effects.<br><br>The intensity level of a status is indicated by the number of chevrons on the icon. One chevron indicates the weakest form of an effect, and three chevrons indicates the strongest form.

Aura reading abilities are great for locating allies, enemies and important objects. <br>Certain highlighted elements in the environment are not considered aura reading effects, thus are not affected by the Blindness Status Effect.
	Some perks and add-ons can trigger <b>obsession</b> gameplay. If this happens, one Survivor is selected to be the killer's obsession for the trial. The killer and the obsession will see The Entity's claws around the obsession's status icon, but other Survivors will not know who the obsession is until they die or escape. <br><br>The effects of obsession depend on the perks and add-ons that triggered it.
	There are 5 randomly positioned <b>dull totems</b> in each trial. Survivors can cleanse these totems for extra bloodpoints.<br><br>Some perks, called <b>hex perks</b>, will transform a dull totem into a <b>hex totem</b>, which can be identified by its distinctive lit candles. Cleansing a hex totem will deactivate the associated hex perk and dispel its curse.
	<b>Daily Rituals</b> are optional tasks that can be completed to earn extra bloodpoints. Players can receive a new daily ritual every day and may have up to 3 at once. There are daily rituals for both Survivors and killers, but most are specific to a role. 
	The <b>Shrine of Secrets</b> contains 4 teachable perks that can be unlocked with <b>Iridescent Shards</b>. <br><br>Iridescent shards are awarded for time spent in trials, to a maximum of ten per trial.<br><br>The Shrine of Secrets updates once a week.
	Proficiency Indicators appear above the progress bar when characters perform certain actions. They indicate whether the current action is receiving benefits or penalties from sources such as perks, items or add-ons. Positive effects are displayed in yellow, and negative ones are displayed in red.

	The main objective of a killer is to sacrifice Survivors to The Entity. In order to achieve this objective, a killer should do the following:<br><br><li>Patrol the area and find Survivors.</li><li>Chase, injure and catch Survivors before they escape.</li><li>Carry Survivors to a sacrificial hook and hang them there for the entity to consume.</li><br>Meanwhile, Survivors will be attempting to repair 5 generators to power the 2 exit gates and make their escape. Killers should do everything in their power to stop them. <br>This guide will help you use the killer's abilities to find Survivors and prevent their escape.<br><br><i>We highly recommend consulting <b>"The Survivors"</b> section of this guide to fully understand the extent of their abilities.</i>
	When the trial begins, the first thing most killers will try to do is locate some Survivors. Survivors must repair generators to escape, so killers are likely to encounter Survivors there. Fortunately, killers can read the auras of generators that require repairs, allowing them to see their outlines with unlimited range.<br><br>There are 7 generators in a typical trial. Try to find an efficient patrol route to protect them.<br><br>A generator in progress is a good sign that a Survivor is nearby, so killers should keep their eyes peeled in this situation.<br><br>If the Survivors manage to repair 5 generators, the exit gates regain power and may be opened, allowing the Survivors to escape.
	Killers can damage generators that have been partially repaired by getting close and performing the <b>Damage Generator</b> action. This will cause the generator's repair process to degrade over time.<br><br>A generator that is losing progress can be identified by the fiery sparks it emits. This regression is cancelled when a Survivor resumes repairs.
	The Entity has granted its killers enhanced senses and the ability to pinpoint Survivors who make noise. When a Survivor fails a skill check or rushes an action, killers receive a visual <b>loud noise notification</b>. This visual effect indicates the loud noise source's location.
	Running Survivors leave tracks only the killer can see. These tracks last a few seconds before they fade, and can be very helpful for locating and tracking Survivors. 
	A skilled killer is attentive to the audio cues made by nearby Survivors. Take great care to listen for heavy breathing, footsteps, cracking branches, cawing crows, or the sounds of Survivor actions such as healing or sabotage. Using these audio cues efficiently might lead you straight to a Survivor.
	Another way for killers to track Survivors is by the bloodstains that they leave behind while injured or dying. Bloodstains are harder to see than scratch marks, but they are more precise and a Survivor cannot stop them until they heal. Blood in front of a locker, for example, is a dead giveaway. Like the scratch marks, bloodstains will disappear after a few seconds. 
	When Survivors are located by the killer, they'll usually attempt to run and hide. The pursuit that follows is called <b>the chase</b>.<br><br>Most killers are faster than a Survivor, but Survivors are small, nimble, and have many tricks they can use to gain distance, put obstacles in the killer's way and break line of sight.<br><br>The killer's goal is to keep track of the fleeing Survivor and get close enough to land a devastating hit. The chase ends when the Survivor gets far enough away from the killer, or the killer incapacitates the Survivor.
	As a chase progresses, killers develop a boiling <b>bloodlust</b>.<br><br>Bloodlust is a status effect that grants the killer increased speed. Bloodlust becomes stronger the longer a chase continues, to a maximum of level 3, indicated by 3 chevrons on the status effect icon (see <i>Status Effects</i> in the general section of this guide). <br><br>Bloodlust subsides when a chase ends or a Survivor is successfully hit.
	Vaulting is the action of going through a window or over a pallet. Survivors can vault a window slowly and quietly, or quickly and loudly. By running straight at a window, Survivors can pick up some extra speed for their vault. Most killers are not in a hurry and only have one window vault speed: <i>slow</i>.<br><br>Pallets are found around the map and can be dropped by Survivors to create obstacles for the killer. Killers cannot vault over pallets, but they can take time to <b>destroy</b> them by interacting with them.
	Survivors have 3 health states: <b>healthy</b>, <b>injured</b> and <b>dying</b>.<br>As a killer, here's what each health state means to you:<br><br><b>Healthy</b>: The health state in which Survivors start. Successfully attacking a healthy Survivor puts them in the injured state.<br><br><b>Injured</b>: Even though they limp, Survivors in the injured state have the same movement speed as healthy ones. Injured Survivors leave behind trails of blood and make lots of noise which makes them easier to find. An injured Survivor who is hit again is put into the dying state.<br><br><b>Dying</b>: Survivors in the dying state can only crawl and are unable to interact or perform objectives. However, they are still able to escape if they can crawl to a hatch or open exit gate. Crawling Survivors can be picked up and placed on a hook to be sacrificed. If they are not healed, they will eventually bleed out and die.
	The killer can perform two types of basic attack: a <b>quick attack</b> and a <b>lunge attack</b>.<br><br><b>The quick attack</b> is performed by simply activating the attack interaction. As the name implies, it is quick but has a very short range.<br><br><b>The</b> lunge attack is performed by holding down the attack interaction. It provides greater reach, but can take some practice to master.<br><br>Missing an attack triggers a short cooldown during which the killer's speed is reduced. Killers must be careful to properly aim and time their attacks, or risk allowing Survivors to escape.<br><br>Hitting a healthy Survivor grants them a brief burst of speed. Keep a close eye on their movements during this time in order to continue the pursuit.
	Many Survivor actions can be interrupted, giving the killer a free grab and pick up. To initiate an interrupt, tap the attack interaction at close range while the Survivor is occupied.<br><br>Injured Survivors can be interrupted while vaulting.<br><br>Lunge attacks do not trigger interrupts.
	Once a killer catches a Survivor, their next goal is to carry them to a sacrificial hook. <br>While being carried, Survivors can wiggle and attempt to break free. Their struggles will affect the killer's movements. The Survivor will eventually succeed and escape the killer's grasp, so there is a limited time to transport the Survivor. Fortunately, killers are able to see the auras of available hooks while they are carrying Survivors. Try to plan an efficient route.<br><br>Watch out for other Survivors while transporting a victim, as any action that stuns or blinds a killer will free any carried Survivors.<br><br>If a killer intentionally drops a Survivor, they will remain in the crawling state. Sometimes dropping a Survivor the best option.
	The ultimate goal of the killer is to sacrifice Survivors to The Entity. Once a Survivor is hung on a sacrificial hook, the sacrifice sequence will begin. It has 3 phases.<br><br><b>Phase 1: Summoning Phase</b><br>In this phase, The Entity is being summoned to the hook and takes some time to manifest. Hooked Survivors can be rescued or attempt to free themselves from the hook. These attempts have a 4% chance of success, and failure accelerates the summoning process.<br><br><b>Phase 2: Struggle Phase</b><br> Once The Entity has manifested on the hook, Survivors can no longer attempt to free themselves. They can only struggle to survive. They may still be rescued by other Survivors.<br><br><b>Phase 3: Sacrifice Phase</b><br>The Entity will eventually overpower a hooked Survivor and devour them. The hook itself is destroyed at the end of the sacrifice sequence.<br><br>A Survivor who is rescued or escapes from the hook will progress to the next phase the next time they are hooked. For example, a Survivor who was freed in the summoning phase will progress immediately to the struggle phase the next time they are hooked. A Survivor who was freed during the the struggle phase and hooked again will be immediately sacrificed.<br><br>A killer who sacrifices all 4 Survivors in the trial will earn The Entity's favour.
	Hooks can be destroyed under certain circumstances:<br><br><b>Sabotage:</b> Survivors can use tools or perks to destroy hooks, making them unusable.<br><br><b>Sacrifice:</b> A successful sacrifice destroys the hook that was used.<br><br>The Entity will repair sabotaged hooks after a few minutes, but hooks that were used for sacrifice remain destroyed for the remainder of the trial. <br><br>Basement hooks cannot be destroyed.
	Every level features an underground chamber called <b>The Basement</b>. Survivors should fear being hooked there, as it is not an easily accessible location and features only one way in or out, making rescues particularly risky.<br><br>Though it can often be difficult to bring a carried Survivor to the basement before they escape the killer's grasp, it is an attractive location to perform the sacrifice. Whereas other hooks can be sabotaged, the central basement hooks cannot be disabled or destroyed in any way.
	If Survivors manage to repair 5 generators, the 2 exit gates become accessible. If this happens, the exit locations are shown to all players. Survivors are shown the exits temporarily, but the killer will see their locations for the remainder of the trial. Killers can use their knowledge of the exit locations to predict Survivor movements and catch them in the final stretch.<br><br>Survivors must hold down the switch to open the gates before they can escape, which is a time consuming action and a great opportunity for the killer.
	<b>Memento Moris</b> are killer-specific offerings which influence The Entity to allow killers to kill Survivors by their own hands instead of sacrificing them.<br><br>Memento Moris are a reward from The Entity, and an efficient way to do deal with pesky Survivors, but killers should not rely on them too often. Without sacrifice, The Entity will eventually become <i>displeased</i>. 
	Killers cannot change their power. However, they can customize it. Killers may equip up to 2 power add-ons in the loadout before the trial which have a variety of effects on the killer's power.<br><br>At the end of the trial, any add-ons that were equipped are consumed.
	Killers should be aware of the methods Survivors can use to locate them. Most killers are very large, making them quite easy to see, but there are some other aspects to Survivor perception that are important to keep in mind:<br><br><b>Third Person View:</b> The Survivors have a wide third person perspective. The Survivor player is able to see behind their character and around corners.<br><br><b>Terror Radius:</b>  Survivors hear a heartbeat when the killer approaches. The closer the killer is, the more intense the heartbeat.<br><br><b>The Stain:</b> Survivors can see an eerie red light emitted in front of the killer. The stain can give away the killer's position as well as the direction in which they are looking.<br><br><i>Consult <b>"The Survivors"</b> section of this guide to learn more about the Survivors' abilities.</i>

	The primary objective of a Survivor in a trial is to escape. In order to do so, Survivors must complete the following steps:<br><br><li>Repair 5 generators to power the 2 exit gates</li><li>Open one of the 2 exit gates by holding down its switch</li><li>Leave the trial area</li><br>Meanwhile, the killer will be trying to locate, catch and hook Survivors in order to sacrifice them to The Entity.<br>Even though Survivors are vulnerable, they have a very useful set of core abilities to hide and escape from the Killer. This guide will explain how to use them.<br><br><i>We highly recommend consulting <b>"The Killers"</b> section of this guide to fully understand the extent of their abilities.</i>
	Survivors have 3 health states: <b>healthy</b>, <b>injured</b> and <b>dying</b>.<br>As a Survivor, here's what each health state means to you:<br><br><b>Healthy:</b> Survivors start the trial in this state. Receiving damage while healthy puts Survivors into the injured state.<br><br><b>Injured:</b> While injured, Survivors will bleed and grunt, making them easier to track. Though an injured Survivor limps, their movement speed is the same as when healthy. Receiving damage while injured puts a Survivor into the dying state.<br><br><b>Dying:</b> While in the dying state, a Survivor's movement is limited to a slow crawl. A crawling Survivor has two options: recover as much health as they can, or crawl to find help. Without the aid of specialized perks, a Survivor cannot recover fully; they will need another Survivor to finish healing them. A crawling Survivor can be picked up by the killer and brought to a sacrificial hook.
	The killer downed you and left you to crawl in the dying state? It's not over yet!<br><br>While in the dying state, surviors slowly bleed out. The bleed out progress can be seen below the player's status icon. Dying Survivors can see the auras of their teammates, and vice versa. Dying Survivors can use their teammates' locations to determine whether they should move or attempt to recover.<br><br>Without the aid of specialized perks, a Survivor cannot recover fully by themselves; they will need another Survivor to finish healing them. 
	Survivors are very vulnerable and have few methods of fighting back against the killer. To avoid being caught, they should start by learning how to hide. Basic strategies can include crouching behind obstacles, finding cover in tall grass, tucking into dark corners or getting into lockers. However, to avoid detection, Survivors must gain understanding of the killer's heightened senses.<br><br><b>Scratch Marks:</b> Running is louder than walking, but the real downside to running is the trail it leaves behind. These scratch marks can only be seen by the killer. They disappear after a few seconds, but the trail they leave can lead the killer straight to a running Survivor.<br><br><b>Loud Noises:</b> Some actions, such as window vaults, can be performed quickly or slowly (depending on whether the run button is held). Rushing these actions creates a loud noise notification that the killer can see. Be aware that these actions will give away your position. <br><br><b>Bloodstains:</b> Injured Survivors leave a trail of blood that is visible to all players. Survivors bleed regardless of whether they are walking or running. Bloodstains disappear after a few seconds.<br><br><b>Crows:</b> Crows are servants of The Entity. Survivors who startle them or get too close will cause them to caw loudly and take flight, which can tip off an attentive killer.<br><br><b>Failed Skill Checks:</b> A failed skill check will create a loud noise notification for the killer. Be very careful after failing a skill check! <br><br><i>Consult <b>"The Killers"</b> section of this guide for more information on the killer's abilities.</i>
	Most killers are quite large and easy to spot. However, Survivors have a few extra situational awareness advantages they can use to increase their odds of survival.<br><br><b>Third Person View:</b> Survivors have a versatile third person view that allows them 360 degree situational awareness. It can also be used to look around corners or over obstacles and locate the killer without being seen.<br><br><b>Terror Radius:</b> The killer's approach is indicated by a heartbeat. As the killer gets closer, the heartbeat gets more intense. Experienced Survivors can use the terror radius to accurately determine the distance between themselves and the killer.<br><br><b>The Stain:</b> The Stain is an eerie red light emitted in front of the killer. It is especially good for quickly determining where the killer is looking. If you are in a chase and see the stain bathing your character in its red glow, don't panic. It's too late.
	While performing actions such as repairing, healing or sabotaging, Survivors will periodically trigger <b>skill checks</b>. A skill check is a quick challenge that requires the player to tap a button at the right time. There are three possible outcomes for a skill check.<br><br><b>Good Skill Check:</b> The button is pressed when the red line is within the outlined zone known as the "Good Zone". A good skill check allows the action to resume without penalty.<br><br><b>Great Skill Check:</b> The button is pressed when the red line is within the filled zone known as the "Great Zone". A great skill check allows the action to resume and grants a small bonus towards its progress.<br><br><b>Failed Skill Check:</b> The button is pressed when the red line is outside the good or great zone, or the button is not pressed at all. Failing a skill check creates a great deal of noise and penalizes the action's progress. <br><br>Survivors should always be focused and ready for a skill check to appear. They will hear an audio cue before a skill check is triggered.
	The first step to complete in order to escape is to repair 5 generators. There are a few things to keep in mind while doing so:<br><br><b>Generator Locations:</b> Generator locations are randomly selected before the trial, so they cannot be simply memorized. To find generators, Survivors can try looking for the flashing lights above them or listen for the sounds of partially repaired generators.<br><br><b>Killer Patrols:</b> Killers can see the auras of unrepaired and partially repaired generators. When not engaged in a chase, killers will often patrol the generators searching for Survivors. <br><br><b>Skill Checks:</b> Survivors should be listening for the skill check audio cue while repairing generators. Failing a skill check will cause the generator to explode, which sets back the repair progress and alerts the killer.<br><br><b>Careful Repairs:</b> Repairing a generator takes time and makes noise that can attract the killer; Survivors need to be on their guard. It's a good idea to plan one or more escape routes in case the killer approaches.<br><br><b>The Escape:</b> Once <b>5</b> generators have been repaired, a level-wide siren will alert all players that the exit gates can be opened. Survivors will only be shown the exit locations for a limited time, so they will need to remember where they are. Many Survivors have been caught at the end of a trial searching the perimiter for the exit!
	Survivors can increase their chances of escape by taking care of each other. Here are the main actions that can help:<br><br><b>Healing:</b> Survivors can heal each other, even without a med-kit.<br><br><b>Hook Rescue:</b> Survivors can rescue each other from the hook and prevent the sacrifice.<br><br><b>Shoulder Rescue:</b> Survivors can attempt to blind or stun the killer to make them drop a carried Survivor.<br><br>Though it is possible to play and escape as a lone wolf it can be more difficult once the other Survivors have been killed.  
	Chests can be found during trials. These chests contain helpful items such as med-kits, toolboxes and flashlights. Searching a chest is a somewhat noisy action that can be completed fairly quickly. <br><br>An opened chest has already been looted and is usually empty.
	With the proper items or perks, Survivors can sabotage the killer's tools. Strategic sabotage can be useful and even save lives. <br><br><b>Sabotage Hooks:</b> The hooks found around the map (but not in the basement) can be temporarily disabled with by sabotage. A sabotaged hook cannot be used by the killer until it is repaired by The Entity.<br><br><b>Sabotage Tools:</b> Killer objects, such as The Trapper's bear traps, can be permanently destroyed by sabotage.<br><br><b>Cleanse Totems:</b> Cleansing is a specific interaction done on totems. Cleansing a totem destroys it and disables any hex that was assigned to it. Cleansing does not require any perks or items.<br><br>These actions generate a great deal of noise and will notify the killer when they are completed!
	Certain interactions can be accelerated through cooperation, including healing and repairing.<br><br>Cooperation comes at a cost, however, as a larger group can be easier to spot by the killer and generate more opportunities for failed skill checks that could endanger the entire group.
	When the killer gets too close, it's time to run! Here are some things to keep in mind about chases:<br><br><b>Killer Speed:</b> Most killers are faster than Survivors, and in long chases they will gain even more speed due to <b>bloodlust</b> <i>(consult the status effect section of this guide for more details about bloodlust)</i>.<br><br><b>Vaults:</b> Survivors can vault over windows and pallets very quickly. Killers traverse these obstacles slowly, so they can be used by Survivors to gain distance.<br><br><b>Break line of sight:</b> To survive a chase, a Survivor should try to break line of sight and head in a direction the killer does not expect or cannot anticipate.<br><br><b>Pallets:</b> Pallets are objects the Survivors can throw down in order to put an obstacle between themselves and the killer. Killers can be stunned by dropping a pallet on them directly. Pallets can only be dropped once, after which they can be vaulted by Survivors or destroyed by killers.<br><br>Keeping these points in mind will help you make it out of the chase alive.
	When <b>5</b> generators have been repaired, the exit gates power up and become accessible. Their positions will be temporarily revealed to the Survivors. To open the gate, its switch must be held down for a few seconds. This is a crucial movment, as Survivors are exposed and vulnerable during this time. There's a good chance the killer will head straight for one of the exits as soon as they become powered.<br><br>Once the gate is opened, Survivors can go through and escape. Survivors may also choose to stay in the trial and help other Survivors escape. Taking the risk to stay for others in need is a great way to earn more bloodpoints and a good reputation.
	In order to sacrifice a Survivor, the killer must pick them up and transport them to a sacrificial hook. During this time, the Survivor can wiggle to hinder the killer's movement and attempt to escape his grasp.<br><br>A successful grasp escape puts a Survivor right back on their feet and stuns the killer briefly, giving them a narrow chance to escape.
	The ultimate goal of the killer is to sacrifice Survivors to The Entity. Once a Survivor is hung on a sacrificial hook, the sacrifice sequence will begin. It has 3 phases.<br><br><b>Phase 1: Summoning Phase</b><br>In this phase, The Entity is being summoned to the hook and takes some time to manifest. Hooked Survivors can be rescued or attempt to free themselves from the hook. These attempts have a 4% chance of success, and failure accelerates the summoning process.<br><br><b>Phase 2: Struggle Phase</b><br>Once The Entity has manifested on the hook, the Survivor can no longer attempt to free themselves. They can only fight to survive. They may still be rescued by other Survivors.<br><br><b>Phase 3: Sacrifice Phase</b><br>The Entity will eventually overpower a hooked Survivor and devour them. The hook itself is destroyed at the end of the sacrifice sequence.<br><br>A Survivor who is rescued or escapes from the hook will progress to the next phase the next time they are hooked. For example, a Survivor who was freed in the summoning phase will progress immediately to the struggle phase the next time they are hooked. A Survivor who was freed during the the struggle phase and hooked again will be immediately sacrificed.
	Survivors have access to a variety of useful items. Only one item can be equipped in the loadout, but it can be customized with up to two item add-ons.<br><br>Item use is limited by its amount of charge, which is indicated by the bar next to the item icon in the HUD. Once it has been fully depleted, the item is consumed, along with its add-ons.<br><br>If a Survivor dies during a trial, any carried items and add-ons are lost. If a Survivor escapes, any items they were carrying, along with their add-ons, will be banked in that Survivor's inventory.
	The hatch is a secret door that offers an alternative way for Survivors to escape. The hatch appears mysteriously and is usually closed and locked. A Survivor with a skeleton key can open the hatch for themselves and their fellow Survivors. <br><br>The hatch will also open in the event that there is only one Survivor left alive in the trial.

	A simple street with houses that witnessed the horrors that took place. A jungle gym where children once learned to climb. Sidewalks where fathers taught their daughters to ride a bike. All gone. Instead it sits in the palm of the Entity, forever held in darkness.
	A mansion from the late 1800's - donated and transformed into a medical facility and later into a CIA black site specializing in cutting-edge interrogation techniques. The institute closing is shrouded in controversy and mystery. At the heart of the facility, the Doctor	The Pale Rose, an ancient paddle steamer in the middle of the swamp, is held captive by the stagnant mud. It has been here long before the residents began their hunt, a barely visible silhouette from the nearby village. There are signs of inhabitation, particularly in the upper states room where strange, ritualistic markings in dried blood and dirt cover the floor. From the scale of the bloodletting, something horrid has taken place here.
	Treatment Theatre
	You can still see the tiny entrance that miners used to haul the ore to the surface. Now it is nothing more than a pile of rubble. No one bothered to clear it as they feared whatever might be found inside. Instead it fell into oblivion.
	Once used for storing the coal that fueled the Foundry, it now lies abandoned. The roof is split wide open, suggesting some titanic explosion, but the angles don	The woods surrounding the estate might be the only witness to what really happened here. Its trees have a certain deformed character, as if what they saw made them want to run away. There are very few visitors to the woods - even animals seem to avoid it if possible.
	The beating heart of the Mine, the Foundry was where the iron ore was directly smelted into vast ingots. The huge vats still bear evidence of the bodies that were incinerated within them - preserved in the metal residue.
	On the eastern edge of the estate, near the woods, lie the remains of the MacMillan warehouse. Dwarfing the surrounding buildings, the massive storehouse can often be heard creaking and groaning as if it were crying out with the anguish of the incinerated laborers.
	Groaning Storehouse
	The Pale Rose
	Deep in a forest with many names lies a hidden home. The family that once lived there was dependent on the forest... and was broken by it. More than a century old, the dwelling is in surprisingly good condition, though it shows signs of often being patched and mended. The forest holds the house tightly in its grasp, growing over and around it like a second skin. Only once inside is it clear that someone still lives there. It is warm and welcoming and lovingly decorated, with a large living space, a bedroom and a corner dedicated for little ones. Here they are protected from the harsh winter of the northern forest.
	Mother's Dwelling
	This is not the Badham Preschool where children laughed and learned, made lifelong friendships and had their paintings hung on the walls. This is a dark echo created from the nightmares of those who suffered there. The walls creak under the burden of history. Events that should be long forgotten are recorded forever in the plaster and stone, pervading the building with misery. Only one part of the building is accurately reflected in this darkness. The squalid room where Freddy Krueger lived and worked. The hidden basement area where he committed the heinous acts that appalled a town and condemned him to death. This is a place of the subconscious, of the nightmare brought into hideous reality.
	Badham Preschool
	Lampkin Lane
	One shack stood apart from the rest of the village. Once the water was drained and the area breath the base was revealed, the true horror of the swamp's cage was discovered. It was here that the prisoners, if that's what we should call them, were brought. Held in the water, their bodies bloating horrendously, they were plucked, one by one for the family's needs. The stilts that kept the building upright acted as the only bars that awful jail needed.

	The Doctor
	While in treatment mode, The Doctor's regular attack is replaced with a shock therapy area attack which greatly increases the madness level of any Survivors it hits.
	At madness level II, Survivors experience shared hallucinations that The Doctor can also see. At madness level III, The Doctor can read these hallucinations' auras from a distance.
	When reaching new levels of madness, Survivors scream and reveal their location to all players.
	At madness level III, Survivors cannot repair, heal, sabotage or cleanse. They will also scream periodically, revealing their location. They must stay still and "snap out of it" to return to madness level II.
	The Hillbilly is equipped with a chainsaw that can smash pallets and put Survivors in the dying state in one hit. While using his chainsaw he moves at incredible speed, but is briefly stunned if he collides with objects or walls.
	Facing The Hillbilly
	The Cannibal wields his chainsaw with deadly precision. He can turn easily to hit Survivors all around, which put them in the dying state. The Cannibal suffers a long stun when he collides with objects, be careful has his chainsaw is still lethal during this stun.
	Facing The Cannibal
	The Doctor inflicts madness on his victims using his static field and shock therapy attack. There are 3 tiers of madness with various afflictions. Reaching a madness tier causes Survivors to scream, which reveals their position to all players.

	The Nurse can blink through walls and other solid objects. After blinking, she has a short window in which to attack or blink again before she is affected by fatigue, which reduces her speed and impairs her vision. Try anticipate where she will blink, break line of sight, and escape while she is fatigued.

	The Trapper can set traps almost anywhere. Windows, pallets, choke points and tall grass are all commonly trapped areas. These traps injure and immobilize their victims. Survivors can attempt to escape on their own (25% chance per attempt) or they can be saved by another Survivor.

	The Hag can teleport to any activated phantasm trap for the duration that it is active if she is within teleportation range. Phantasm traps will be highlighted in white when The Hag is in range to teleport and in red when she is not.
	Survivors can avoid triggering phantasm traps by crouching past them. Try placing traps in places Survivors wouldn't expect!
	The Hag can place to 10 phantasm traps in the level at once. Triggered phantasm traps can disorient Survivors and allow The Hag to teleport to them.
	If multiple phantasm traps are activated, The Hag can prioritize which trap she will teleport to by looking in its direction.
	A distinctive audio cue can be heard once the hatchet has been wound up to its maximum strength.

	When out of Hatchets, search in any nearby lockers, indicated by a yellow aura. Every locker refills your Hatchets to maximum.
	When charging the Hatchet throw, The Huntress movement speed is slightly slower. A fully charged Hatchet throw is slightly faster.
	If you lose a Survivor, listen closely! You may hear their footsteps. If they are injured, you'll be able to track them by listening to their groans of pain.
	Running Survivors leave red scratch marks in the environment that only killers can see. Use them to track Survivor movements.
	Killer add-ons can modify their power in many ways. They are consumed once the trial ends.
	Hooking Survivors on the Entity's sacrificial hook is the killer's primary goal and is therefore one of the actions that awards the most bloodpoints.
	Though they share most basic abilities, every killer has a unique power.
	Generators undergoing repairs make a lot of noise. This can tip the killer off to the Survivors' location, or it can be used by Survivors to mask other noisy actions such as healing.
	Loud noise events, such as when a Survivor misses a skill check, alert the killer of the Survivor's location.
	The killer sees the aura (outline) of all unrepaired generators. Patrolling generators is a great way to find Survivors.
	Killers can break dropped pallets. This action takes some time, but renders the pallet completely unusable.
	A healthy Survivor hit by the killer will enter the injured state. Another successful hit will put the Survivor into the dying state. A dying Survivor can be picked up by the killer and brought to a sacrificial hook.
	During a chase, the killer must pay attention to the environment and the Survivor's movements to guess their next move.
	Survivors can aim their flashlights directly at the killer's eyes to blind them briefly and make them drop any Survivors they were carrying. The time required to blind a killer depends on the flashlight and add-ons used.
	Survivors can escape a Killers grasp by "wiggling free", which takes some time. Killers must make haste to a hook before Survivors wiggle free. A successful wiggle free will stun the killer for a few seconds.
	Survivors can drop pallets on the killer to stun them temporarily.
	Crows can be found in every level. These servants of the entity will take off and caw when disturbed. Killers can use the crows to pinpoint the location of moving Survivors.
	Hold down the attack interaction to perform a lunge attack. This attack grants a burst of speed, but the killer is slowed while they recover.
	Once The Entity has consumed a Survivor on a sacrificial hook, that hook is destroyed and can no longer be used. This does not apply to basement hooks, which cannot be destroyed.
	Injured Survivors leave trails of blood. Follow the blood trail to catch them before they can heal.
	Experienced Survivors tend to run with a plan. When chasing, try to identify windows, pallets and line of sight blockers in the area to predict Survivors' movements.
	Many Survivor actions can be interrupted, giving the killer a free grab and pick up. To initiate an interrupt, activate the attack interaction at close range while the Survivor is occupied. Lunge attacks do not trigger interrupts. The Entity is especially amused by interrupted hatch escapes.
	Hitting a healthy Survivor grants them a short burst of speed.
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
	At Evil Within tier I, The Shape has a very small terror radius which allows him to lurk near his victims without alerting them of his presence.
	The Shape
	The Shape
	The Shape
	The Shape
	The Shape
	The Shape must keep Survivors in his line of sight while stalking in order to build up his power.
	When The Shape's Evil Within reaches tier III, he changes stance. For a limited time, his window vault speed and lunge range are increased and his attacks automatically put Survivors in the dying state.
	The Shape increases the power of his Evil Within by stalking Survivors.
	There is a limit to how much power The Shape can gain from stalking a Survivor. If a stalked Survivor's highlight is bright red, no more power can be gained from stalking that Survivor.
	After blinking, The Nurse has a short window to either attack or blink again (if she has blinks remaining) before becoming fatigued. Attacking after blinking increases fatigue time.
	The Nurse
	The Nurse
	The Nurse

	The Nurse
	The Nurse
	The Nurse gets fatigued for a few seconds after a blink. During this time, The Nurse cannot attack or interact and has limited vision.
	The Nurse can travel long distances quickly, through walls and objects, using her blink ability.
	The longer The Nurse charges her blink, the further the distance she can travel.
	The Nurse's blink power comes at a cost. Her base movement speed is slower than most killers.
	When The Nurse is holding a fully charged blink, she clenches her fist.
	Survivors should be mindful of their actions. Running leaves tracks only the killer can see. Loud, rushed actions like fast window vaults or quick locker entry trigger visual notifications for the killer as well.
	When injured, a Survivor can be healed by another Survivor, or they can heal themselves with a med-kit.
	When injured, a Survivor is easier to locate. An injured Survivor is more noisy and leaves behind a trail of blood.
	Survivors are awarded bloodpoints for completing objectives, evading the killer, surviving the trial, and helping other Survivors.
	A Survivor in the dying state cannot fully recover to the injured state on their own without the help of a perk or another Survivor to help them.
	Skillful interactions such as repairing, healing or sabotaging will periodically trigger skill checks. There is an audio notification before a skill check appears.
	Generators can often be located by searching for the flashing lights above them.
	Failing a skill check sets back an action's progress and notifies the killer of the Survivor's location.
	If a Survivor does not survive the trial, they lose any items and add-ons that they were carrying.
	Survivors can attempt to evade killers by hiding in lockers. Killers can search lockers, but spend precious time doing so.
	A hooked Survivor can be rescued by other Survivors. In the first phase of the sacrifice, they may also attempt to unhook themselves (with a 4% base chance to succeed) at the cost of accelerating the sacrifice progress.
	The number beside the generator icon indicates how many more generators the Survivors must repair before the exit gates can be opened.
	The terror radius, also known as the heartbeat, indicates the killer's approach. The more intense it is, the closer the killer is!
	Survivors vault more quickly through a window when running, but they are much louder and notify the killer of their location.
	Dropping a pallet creates a loud noise that gives away your position to the killer. It can also be used as a diversion.
	Offerings are consumed once the match starts, unless they conflict with other offerings.
	While in a trial, Survivors can swap their carried item for other items found in a chest or on the ground.
	Dull totems can always be found scattered throughout the trial area. Certain killer perks (called hex perks) activate dull totems and turn them into hex totems. Cleansing a hex totem deactivates its associated hex perk. All totems grant bloodpoints when they are cleansed.
	Successfully escaping the killer during a chase awards Survivors with bloodpoints.
	Once enough generators have been repaired, the Survivors' goal is to activate one of the two exit switches which will open the exit gate for Survivors to escape through.
	Actions such as repairing generators or healing injured allies are performed much faster when cooperating with other Survivors.
	A Survivor who is hooked for the third time (or the second time if they reached the second phase of the sacrifice) will automatically summon the Entity to complete the sacrifice sequence.
	If you are the last Survivor left alive, the hatch may be available as an alternate escape! Look for the hatch icon beside the number of generators that need to be completed. If the icon is present then the hatch is open. Find the hatch and make a swift exit.
	Carried Survivors can attempt to wiggle free from the killer's grasp. If a Survivor succeeds before the killer hooks them, the killer is momentarily stunned so that the Survivor can make a quick escape.
	Pay attention to the killer's red stain. It tells you in which direction they are looking.
	Survivors can scavenge items from chests which may increase their odds of survival.
	The Entity will temporarily block a window if a Survivor vaults through it repeatedly in a short time. The window is only blocked for the Survivor that abused it.
	Dropping a pallet on a killer momentarily stuns them.
	Survivors in the dying state can still escape by crawling to the exit gates or the hatch.
	Pay attention to the other Survivors' status icons. They will let you know if Survivors are injured, dying or hooked.

	Windows, pallets and narrow paths are great strategic locations to place bear traps.
	The Trapper is notified when a Survivor steps in one of his bear traps. Once a Survivor is trapped it's a race to grab the Survivor before they can struggle free or be saved by a teammate.
	A careless Trapper can step into his own bear trap, causing him to drop any Survivor he was carrying.
	A Survivor with a toolbox or the Saboteur perk can sabotage bear traps and make them unusable.
	A cloaked Wraith is fully invisible while still, but causes a slight distortion while moving. He can also be detected by listening for his snarl or by certain detection perks.

	The Wraith's movement speed is reduced while cloaking or uncloaking.
	The Wraith is vulnerable to flashlights while cloaked. Aiming the beam at The Wraith's body will burn him out of invisibility. He finds this very unpleasant.
	While cloaked, The Wraith is faster and has no terror radius. He can interact with lockers,pallets and generators, but he cannot attack.
	The Wraith must ring his bell in order to cloak or uncloak. Survivors hear the Wraith successfully cloaking from 40 meters, and the Survivors within 24 meters hear the ringing of the bell.
