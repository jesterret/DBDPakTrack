    Once opulent and well-tended by priests, the shrine was abandoned for reasons unknown. Season after season, the harsh and unforgiving weather corroded its grandeur. Paths that welcomed weary travelers, were now thick with vegetation growing damp and unrestrained. The sculptures were a haven for moss and lichen, concealing a scratched and brittle stone.<br><br>Kazan shuddered with rage as he stepped into the area. Unable to restrain himself, he unleashed his might on a statue atop the shrine, clubbing its arms and head to pieces. Even after he left, a rot seemed to pervade the air. The chimes of bells played softly on the wind, as everything around them crumbled. Torn from Kazan's memories, the shrine now stood on the estate of his childhood home—a trick by The Entity that infuriated him even more.

    I have culled imprints of a killer I have yet to observe. My best guess, judging by the nature of the crimes, is this brute is from Terra Dark. She lured men with love, robbed them of their savings and fed them to her pigs. Lovely. Efficient. And resourceful. The impressions of the memory are as follows…<br><br>…He stands framed in the doorway with flowers. A stupid smile on his dumb face. He has no sense that his days are numbered. Lonely soul made the trip for a wife. He thinks he'll get everything for a ring. Her land. Her farm. Her savings. Won't happen. Won't go as planned. Not as he planned, anyway. It didn't for all the other lonely souls who answered her classified ad. She peers at his eyes and thrills at his ignorance. His long, dumb face. His false sense of superiority. He wrote her a poem. How sweet. She'll cram it down his throat when he's convulsing on the floor. She takes his poem and asks about his money. He has it with him. Packed his savings in a bag and made the journey for a new start. He'll get more than he bargained for. Way more. To the bank with his money. To the pigs with him.

    Most Killers are quite large and easy to spot. However, Survivors do have a few extra situational awareness advantages they can use to increase their odds of survival.<br><br><b>Third Person View:</b> Survivors have a versatile third person view which grants them 360 degree situational awareness. It can also be used to look around corners or over obstacles and locate the Killer without being seen.<br><br><b>Terror Radius:</b> The Killer's approach is signalled by a heartbeat. As the Killer gets closer, the heartbeat intensifies. Experienced Survivors can use the Terror Radius to accurately determine the distance between themselves and the Killer.<br><br><b>The Stain:</b> The Stain is an eerie red light emitted in front of the Killer. It is especially good for quickly determining where the Killer is looking. If you are in a chase and see the stain bathing your character in its red glow, don't panic. It's too late.

    Claudette will be eight-years-old tomorrow. She should be eager. She should be excited. She should be counting the hours, minutes, seconds... Instead, she is none of these. She dreads the moment she will have to open her gift. Every year it's the same. Dolls. Crafts. Jewelry. Nothing that means anything to her. Maybe this year she'll smile and pretend she didn't want a magnifying glass or a collection of stones or a set of books on botany. Maybe… to make things easier… she'll pretend. Maybe that will make her mother less scared for her. Seeing her happy about her grades felt good. Real good.

    I have been obsessively deciphering Vigo’s journal. His work is elegant but erratic, drawing obscure conclusions from disjointed fields.<br><br>Most entries mention a powerful force, The Entity, which undergoes a purge that occurs once a year. During this period, The Entity is infested with blight. According to Vigo, cankers bloom into “Pustulas,” a type of flower that spurts putrid nectar—the thick fluid I saw oozing from the trees. The last pages of the journal mention a serum distilled from the nectar, but the pages detailing its effects and preparation were torn out.

    I discovered a hidden laboratory while running away from a monster. Its stocks are uncommonly plentiful. I observed shelves of alkaloids, crates of silver syringes, piles of protective clothes and a journal signed “Vigo.” Its pages are filled with notes on an ancient force that controls the nature of this place—that shapes it. I also noted a few drawings of the growing cankers I’ve seen on trees.

    Survivors have 3 health states: <b>healthy</b>, <b>injured</b> and <b>dying</b>.<br>As a Killer, here's what each health state means to you:<br><br><b>Healthy</b>: The health state in which Survivors start. Successfully attacking a healthy Survivor puts them in the injured state.<br><br><b>Injured</b>: Even though they limp, injured Survivors have the same movement speed as when healthy. They leave behind trails of blood and make lots of noise which makes them easier to find. An injured Survivor who takes a second hit is put into the dying state.<br><br><b>Dying</b>: Survivors in the dying state can only crawl and are unable to interact or complete objectives. However, they are still able to escape if they can crawl to a Hatch or open an Exit Gate. Crawling Survivors can be picked up and placed on a hook to be sacrificed. If not healed, they will eventually bleed out and die.
    Mind's Eye
    Showing exceptional aptitude in psychology, Herman, was handpicked for special training in an advanced neuroscience program located in a secret black site facility in Illinois known as the Léry Memorial Institute, really a front for the CIA. This is where Herman met Dr. Otto Stamper where under his guidance, Herman began to use strange and ever increasingly vicious methods to extract information from prisoners sent to the institute, which was also a covert prison and re-education center for whoever was a USA’s current nemesis. His liberal use of violent electroshock therapy revealed dramatic results and several threats to national security were uncovered.<br><br>Over the years, Herman became known as The Doctor and no one ever questioned if he had even held a medical certificate or even what happened to the prisoners after they had given up their information. It was only after the Léry Memorial Institute went silent for a week that the true horror was finally discovered. The personnel, patients, and prisoners were all found dead with all types of head trauma. All personnels and prisoners bodies were accounted for, including Dr. Otto Stamper, but no sign of Herman “The Doctor” Carter.<br>

    FIGHT CLUB
    Frank Morrison was nineteen and had little to show for it. He’d stopped attending school after being kicked out of the basketball team for shoving a referee into the stands. Yet Frank was a man of potential, who could light up a room despite his bleak childhood. At six years old, he’d been taken away from Calgary to start a circuit of foster homes. No matter how many times he’d lashed out, threw tantrums and got into fights, they’d kept moving him to new, unfamiliar houses. His last move had been three years prior when his last foster dad, Clive Andrews, had picked him up from the adoption center. They’d been on the road for seven hours before reaching a small bungalow in Ormond. It would be the longest time they’d spend together. Clive was too busy trading cheques from Family Services for drinks at the bar.<br><br>Ormond was a small, stale place; a remote town of six thousand inhabitants where gray winters drag on for most of the year. Frank did everything he could to get into another adoptive family, but he changed his mind when he caught the attention of a beautiful girl. Julie was a popular girl who was convinced that she deserved better than a life in Ormond, and Frank, as an outsider, was her ticket out. Frank attended the parties she threw where everyone was younger than him and easily impressed, which he liked. He met the impulsive Joey, who liked to show off, and the shy, naive Susie, who was Julie’s best friend.<br><br>They would hang out at an abandoned lodge up Mount Ormond. Their time together was the perfect break from the boring conformity of their small, insignificant everyday lives. Frank saw it as an opportunity to shape their lack of experience into something powerful. He lined up nights of debauchery and rampage, testing their limits. Bullying, vandalism, and theft were essentially their weekend plans. It came to a point where they would do anything he asked. Nothing was off-limits when they put their masks on. One evening, Frank dared Joe to vandalize the store that had recently fired him. They snuck inside easily enough as the building was supposed to be empty after closing hours. But a cleaner who was still there grabbed Julie as soon as she came near. Hearing her stifled cries, a dark impulse took over Frank. He rushed to her aid knife in hand and, without hesitating, planted the blade into the cleaner’s back.<br><br>As the group stared at Frank in shock, he ordered them to finish the job. Jo clenched his jaw, grabbed the knife, and stabbed the bleeding man in the ribs. Susie didn’t want to do it. Frank shouted at her; they had to finish what they’d started. Julie closed her eyes and jabbed the knife into the man’s chest. She handed the wet blade to Susie: they were all in this together now. Susie stared at Julie in disbelief as Frank grabbed her trembling hands and inserted the knife deep into the man’s throat. Frank told them to move fast: they mopped the blood off the floor, stashed the body in the trunk of Joe’s car and drove up Mount Ormond.<br><br>All four were digging in the muddy snow to dispose of the body when Frank spotted something moving through the woods. He grabbed his knife and broke from the group to check it out. The Fog thickened around Frank, becoming so dense that he soon could no longer see ahead. He retraced his steps and stumbled on an ominous trail. He followed the eerie path, as if called by the darkness.  Julie, Susie, and Joe finished digging but Frank was nowhere to be seen. Julie spotted his muddy footsteps in the snow and the three of them followed the trail, which took them deeper into the woods. When Julie, Susie, and Joe did not return home that night, their parents thought they’d run away with Frank. Each family came up with a different theory. The mood of the town changed, however, when a body was found by an abandoned lodge up Mount Ormond.

    During a weekend at a cabin with friends, Ashley J. Williams uncovered the Necronomicon Ex-Mortis (the Book of the Dead) and awoke something dark in the woods. Evil possessed his friends, whom he was forced to kill, and his right hand, which he sawed off. For the next thirty years, Ash ran from his past, working at a Value Stop department store and seducing women in dive bars. But he screwed up one night while being high, when he read from the Necronomicon to impress a woman. Evil found him once more, wrecking the life of those around him. But his coworkers, Pablo who was raised by a shaman and Kelly who was orphaned by the Deadites, helped him put up a fight. While battling Evil, Ash was reunited with his long-lost daughter Brandy, who encouraged him to embrace his role as savior of humanity. After a terrible fight with a fully formed demon, Ash, drawing his last breath, was taken by the Knights of Sumeria and transported into the future.<br><br>Ash awakened to a voice, his head throbbing. Since defeating a gang of Deadites a week ago, he had been in a perpetual state of hangover. He heard the voice once more; a woman singing, sensual and inviting.<br><br>Stepping into the corridor in his boxers, he strode toward the voice, which lead to the public locker room. As Ash pushed open the door, the singing stopped. There was a rustling of curtains. He called out, entering the change room. His voice reverberated on the moldy tiled walls. He pressed on, reaching a shower that was still dripping wet. Cold, humid fingers ran down his bare back. He turned around.<br><br>A woman stood naked, her skin glistening in the morning light that streamed in from high windows. Ash recognized her instantly: Linda Emery, one of his former high school flings. They had gotten back together thirty years later, while saving their hometown from Evil. He had ended their relationship soon afterward, preferring to indulge freely in his new-found popularity.<br><br>Linda winked at Ash, who closed the distance between them. He caressed her cheek wistfully: <i>What was she doing here? Did she know anything about the whereabouts of her daughter? And Pablo and Kelly?</i><br><br>A sharp blade dug into his hand, making him jump back. Linda slid a finger across the edge of her blade, collecting Ash’s blood on her fingertip. She smiled, and her skin shriveled, her hair faded, her shoulders stooped, and her curves sagged, aging decades older in a matter of seconds. She attacked Ash, who poorly managed to block, being half-naked.<br><br>Every blow she delivered earned him a new wound. She slashed his bad knee and he fell to the floor. As she jumped on top of him, Ash shrieked in disgust, knocking the knife out of her grasp. Her varicose hands wrapped around his neck, strangling him. Gasping, he outstretched his arm, hand landing on a soap dispenser. He spurted out some liquid on his fingers and poked her in the eyes. The elderly woman winced, weakening her hold, and Ash elbowed her in the face, knocking her back. He rolled over and grabbed the knife on the floor. Just as he was about to plant it in her chest, he stopped. There was something else he wanted more.<br><br>He pressed the blade against her throat. <i>Let’s make a deal, demon. In exchange for not killing you, you portal me back to my friends.</i> The demon agreed.<br><br>She began reciting the incantation, instructing Ash to repeat after her, which he failed to manage. When nothing happened, Ash threatened the demon, who argued back, blaming his poor pronunciation. Their combined exchange of Sumerian words triggered a hiss from the showers behind them. The wet tiled floor darkened, and the pipes burst. A whirlpool of dirty water, shower curtains, and used toilet paper swallowed the demon, while Ash held onto a locker door, which slowly slipped from his fingers.<br><br><i>FFFUUUC—</i><br><br>Ash landed flat on his chest in the realm of the Entity, sputtering grass. He got up, brushing off the dry clothes he suddenly had on. Then he looked around and his grin fell. It was the kind of place that made two things obvious: one, there wasn’t any bar for miles, and two, he was going to need his shotgun and chainsaw, both of which he lacked. As he started to walk toward a glinting light ahead, a scream rippled through the trees.<br><br><i>Groovy.</i>

    The ultimate goal of the Killer is to sacrifice Survivors to The Entity. Once a Survivor is hung on a sacrificial hook, the sacrifice sequence will begin. It has 3 phases.<br><br><b>Phase 1: Summoning Phase</b><br>In this phase, The Entity is being summoned to the hook and takes some time to manifest. Hooked Survivors can be rescued or attempt to free themselves from the hook. These attempts have a 4% chance of success, and failure accelerates the summoning process.<br><br><b>Phase 2: Struggle Phase</b><br> Once The Entity has manifested itself around the hook, Survivors can no longer attempt to free themselves. They can only struggle to survive. They may still be rescued by other Survivors.<br><br><b>Phase 3: Sacrifice Phase</b><br>The Entity will eventually overpower a hooked Survivor and devour them. The hook itself is destroyed at the end of the sacrifice sequence.<br><br>A Survivor who is rescued or escapes from the hook will progress to the next phase the next time they are hooked. For example, a Survivor who was freed in the summoning phase will progress immediately to the struggle phase the next time they are hooked. A Survivor who was freed during the the struggle phase and hooked again will be immediately sacrificed.<br><br>A Killer who sacrifices all 4 Survivors in the trial will earn The Entity's favor.

    WINTER TALES
    For decades, Azarov’s Gas Heaven offered the last chance for travellers to rest and fuel up before the long, hard haul through the backcountry. Wiser travellers learned to decline that offer. The phones never worked and people had a peculiar habit of going missing. When the highway came through, bypassing Gas Heaven entirely, business dried up and the gas station was abandoned. No one quite knows how many bodies are stashed out there, or what else is hidden in the ruins of the old rest stop.

    The Entity is the cosmic embodiment of evil. Back home we witnessed how its very presence turns worlds inside out… how it seems to remove or extinguish any sense of empathy or compassion within communities… how it brings people to the brink of madness and… well… pushes them in. Now I understand it does all this in order to rip victims from their lives and have them play out an endless trial of terror that it presumably needs for its own survival.  And there, perhaps, lies the key to its destruction… if an Ancient can be destroyed at all.<br><br>End the trials. Destroy its ability to sap dark nectar from victims like a cruel parasite feeding from a flower. At least the Archives affords me a better understanding of the Entity… why it moves from universe to universe, picking victims off and devouring worlds as though at a cosmic buffet. What I have yet to conclude is whether it is attracted to worlds that are brimming with darkness and madness or if it is in fact the catalyst of such darkness and madness.

    This is not the Badham Preschool where children laughed and learned, made lifelong friendships and had their paintings hung on the walls. This is a dark echo created from the nightmares of those who suffered there. The walls creak under the burden of history. Events that should be long forgotten are recorded forever in the plaster and stone, pervading the building with misery. Only one part of the building is accurately reflected in this darkness. The squalid room where Freddy Krueger lived and worked. The hidden basement area where he committed the heinous acts that appalled a town and condemned him to death. This is a place of the subconscious, of the nightmare brought into hideous reality.

    Despite her traditional upbringing, Yui Kimura raced scooters in her hometown of Hida where she earned the reputation of being able to do the impossible with very little. Her father did his best to steer her away from what he believed to be masculine pursuits, but her grandmother secretly shared her grandfather’s engineer manuals and notes on car and motorcycle engines. Yui read her grandfather’s manuals and learned fast. She was able to not only maintain her scooter, but she modified the engine so that she could compete with older boys on motor crosses. With her grandfathers ‘good luck hachimaki’ wrapped around her arm, she raced local boys who, unable to keep up with her, worked together to orchestrate her defeat. No luck for them. Yui outmaneuvered them at every turn and became a sensation to all her friends.  When it came time to apply for school, Yui gathered her courage and confessed her ambition to race motorcycles to her father. An altercation ensued and when Yui refused to apply for a proper education, her father felt a great shame and told her she was no longer welcome in their home. With a heavy heart, Yui left for Nagoya with the blessings and savings of her grandmother.<br><br>Nagoya was not what Yui expected. She could only find low grade clerical work or minor jobs as a hostess. With the last of the money her grandmother gave her, she purchased a racing bike and entered illegal street races where she won more money than she had ever seen. Rumors of her courage and quick reflexes spread like wildfire. Soon she had an unofficial retinue of women motorcyclists wearing Yui’s signature pink. Along with a gang following her, Yui realized she had a stalker following her in the shadows. When Yui realized her lucky handkerchief had been stolen from her apartment, she took her concerns to the police who laughed and dismissed her, saying her stalker was probably a nice guy and that she would probably marry him in the near future.<br><br>One evening Yui returned home to find the stalker in her apartment going through her things. He hadn’t seen her, and she wasn’t sure what she should do. But the sight of him going through her clothes was too much to bear. She yelled for him to leave.  The stalker turned to her with a knife. He lunged at her.  She evaded his attack, and he hit the wall and dropped his knife. Without hesitation, Yui tackled him. They rolled over the ground exchanging desperate blows. Yui took more blows than she had ever experienced racing scooters in Shirakawa. With a surge of adrenaline, she managed to overpower her stalker, snatching the knife from the floor and holding the razor-sharp blade to his neck.<br><br>When the police reached her apartment, they took him away and rushed Yui to the hospital for trauma. X-rays revealed she had broken her arm and foot in several places. It wasn’t long before her gang showed up one by one and together they helped her pay her medical bills.  Rehabilitation was difficult but Yui never gave up and with the support of her gang she was ready for the races. Yui’s first race after the attack her gang presented her with a new pink hachimaki with their signatures and good luck messages written all over it. Yui vowed she would help other women with her winnings and influence. True to her word, her gang became known as the Sakura 7 Gang and they wore pink hachimakis as a symbol of unity and support for women needing help from stalkers and abusers.<br><br>The Sakura 7 grew beyond the 7 members and Yui’s signature pink became synonymous with women’s empowerment. At street races women would line up in droves to support her. After winning seven straight races in a row, she attracted the attention of a sponsor. She not only earned a spot at the All-Japan Moto Championship but was the youngest woman to race and win in the prestigious event. Her sponsorship soon tripled. So, too, did her gang. But everything came to a staggering halt at the illegal TK3 (Tokyo Kick 3000) street races. Yui was leading the race until she entered an unnatural fog that seemed to have appeared from nowhere. Baffled and confused, she stopped her bike and dismounted. It wasn’t long before she realized she wasn’t in Tokyo anymore.

    Popular and arrogant, yet compassionate, Steve Harrington is an unlikely mentor and leader. He often acts as a surrogate big brother to a younger boy named Dustin. He even helped him find his slimy inter-dimensional pet Demogorgon, D’Artagnan.  His reputation as a protector grew and he soon became a sort of ‘babysitter’ for a group of kids in Hawkins with a knack for messing around with strange and dangerous things. His courage is unmatched so that he was even able to fend off a Demogorgon when it threatened his friends. One evening he received a call for assistance from his friend Nancy Wheeler. He drove all the way to the Hawkins National Laboratory to see if she was okay. He searched the area but only found her notebook. Before he realized what was happening the ground opened up and a swirl of black mist filled his eyes. When he awakened he was in a strange place that seemed familiar but unfamiliar at the same time.

    Ormond was once a small, remote ski town with idyllic slopes, but its resort turned obsolete when a deluxe ski village was built on Mount Richards less than two hours away. Mount Richards offered fresh slopes with luxurious stores and hotels, which crushed Mount Ormond’s isolated, decrepit facilities.<br><br>The fate of the mountain worsened when a mining project took interest in the coal present at its summit. The mountaintop was lined by explosives to extract coal seams from under it. The project caused a public outrage and was stopped midway.<br><br>Mount Ormond is now a soulful, deforested graveyard where gangs and teenagers go looking for trouble. Some people say that the mountain hides a darkness, a bottomless hole from where no one can return.

    Nea grew up in the small town of Hjo in Sweden. She had a happy childhood even though her mom and dad worked hard. As the opportunity to move to the US became a reality, she started acting out. Nea was forced to leave her friends and life behind. <br><br>Nea shied away from what her parents considered “normal”. Instead she took refuge in skate parks, and her tag “Mashtyx” was seen more or less all over her new hometown. <br><br>Nea made a sport out of tagging government buildings, avoiding the fuzz and any other danger with her nimble cat-like abilities. Finally Nea’s parents became used to her disappearing for a few days on end. She may have gone too far when her friends dared her to tag the old Crotus Prenn Asylum one moonless night, as she was never seen again.
    She emerged from captivity when the serum sparked her ancestral rage, making her blood boil with fury.

    While performing actions such as repairing, healing or sabotaging, Survivors will periodically trigger <b>Skill Checks</b>. A Skill Check is a quick challenge that requires the player to tap a button at the right time. There are three possible outcomes for a Skill Check.<br><br><b>Good Skill Check:</b> The button is pressed when the red line is within the outlined zone known as the "Good Zone". A good Skill Check allows the action to resume without penalty.<br><br><b>Great Skill Check:</b> The button is pressed when the red line is within the filled zone known as the "Great Zone". A great Skill Check allows the action to resume and grants a small bonus towards its progress.<br><br><b>Failed Skill Check:</b> The button is pressed when the red line is outside the good or great zone, or the button is not pressed at all. Failing a Skill Check creates a great deal of noise and penalizes the action's progress. <br><br>Survivors should always be focused and ready for a Skill Check to appear. They will hear an audio cue before a Skill Check is triggered.

The stilts that kept the building upright acted as the only bars that awful jail needed.

    When John Kramer, better known as Jigsaw, planned for his son to be born during the Chinese Zodiac’s Year of the Pig, he wanted it to represent fertility and rebirth; a new beginning for him and his wife, and the start of a charmed life for his son. But that plan was shattered on the night that a junkie broke into his wife’s clinic, hoping to score. <br><br>After this event resulted in the death of his unborn son, John finally caught up with the junkie, making him his first test subject, and the Pig was changed forever too. It became a representation of the disease that was rotting John from the inside, a reminder that we are just meat unless we elevate ourselves through our actions, by grasping life from the jaws of death.<br><br>The Pig became a vessel, an agent of Jigsaw, conveying the subjects to their test. For some of those who emerged victorious, the Pig could still be a rebirth, into their new lives as apprentices, even disciples, of Jigsaw. <br><br>That was the case for Amanda Young, a troubled soul, whose life had been a catalogue of harm, both to herself and those around her. That changed when she faced, and bested, Jigsaw’s test. Deciding her life was worth something, she became devoted to Jigsaw’s cause, ready to take over when the cancer consumed him.<br><br>But she became more dependent on John, her anguish at his impending death combining with a belief that their test subjects weren’t capable of saving themselves, of being reborn in the crucible of the games. <br><br>Seeing this, John presented her with another game, another chance to save herself, but Amanda let her rage and jealousy rule her actions. She failed the test and took a bullet as a consequence. <br><br>Bleeding out on the tiled floor, darkness engulfed Amanda’s vision, accompanied by a sound like creaking wood. Then she was in a forest, once more viewing the world through the eyes of a Pig. Trees surrounded her, their branches clawing at her from all sides. Waves of panic washed over her and she could hear her breath reverberating inside the mask.<br><br>Had she been damned, cursed to spend her days here, in this guise? Or maybe this was another test? Maybe she hadn’t failed at all? John always thought one step ahead of everyone else, planned for every eventuality, and he would never give up on her, surely?<br><br>Jigsaw may have gone but he had passed her onto another. A being for whom she would be The Pig again.<br><br>Ultimately, she saw now that she had been right in the choices she had made. The time for games was over. There was no chance of redemption for any of them. They were meat, and meat was destined for slaughter.

    Honoring his family name was never enough for Kazan Yamaoka. He wanted to surpass his father’s reputation and end what he saw as the thinning of samurai culture with farmers often posing as samurai.  His father tried to turn Kazan’s attention to more noble pursuits, but Kazan refused to heed his advice, and borrowing his father’s katana, he embarked on a dark pilgrimage to prove his worth and rid Japan of imposters. Ignoring the code that had been taught to him, Kazan killed imposters in the hills and the valleys, on the beaches and in the woodland. The killings were brutal, cruel and morbid. He humiliated farmers and warriors alike, yanking off their topknots and stripping them of their armor. His rage, bloodlust and perverse sense of honor knew no bounds. Monks believed he was possessed by something dark and otherworldly and cursed him while a noble lord began to call him ‘Oni-Yamaoka,’ the rageful samurai, an insult both to Kazan and his family.<br><br>Determined to redeem his family’s name, Kazan now butchered anyone who dared call him Oni-Yamaoka. The insult confused him. He had defeated the best and he had purified the samurai class by ridding the land of imposters. How could anyone refer to him as an ogre? Had it been because he had marched onto a battlefield to cut down the fiercest warriors. Had it been because he had taken a kanabo and dashed hundreds of skulls with it?  Or had it been because of his need to secure a ‘trophy’ from his victims. It didn’t matter. Being called an ogre was more than he could bear and an ominous voice in his head urged him to strike down the lord who had desecrated his name.<br><br>As Kazan made for the lord’s town, he suddenly found himself face to face with a samurai standing on a dirt road, blocking his way. Kazan readied his kanabo. Without a word, the samurai attacked and quickly secured the upper hand. But he hesitated. With a devastating blow, Kazan crushed the samurai’s head and cracked his helmet. As Kazan approached the fallen samurai, he saw his father’s face and staggered back to his haunches. His father stared at Kazan with mingled shame and regret as he issued his last breath. Kazan closed his eyes and screamed in agony until he could scream no more. When he opened his eyes again… his father was gone. Not only had he killed his father, but he had allowed thieves to steal his body for armor.<br><br>Bitter, lost and disillusioned, Kazan roamed the land aimlessly with his father’s voice rattling in his head, taunting him, reminding him of his failures, sending him into fits of uncontrollable black rage. One day, walking in the woods, Kazan happened upon an Oni statue. He stopped and stood motionless for a long moment. The weathered and overgrown statue seemed to be ridiculing him, accusing him of being the imposter samurai he had so desperately sought to destroy. Kazan shook the laughing voice out of his head and half remembered the lord who had ridiculed him as ‘Oni-Yamaoka.’<br><br>With renewed anger, Kazan journeyed to a town high up in the snowy mountains where the lord resided. A dozen samurai met Kazan at the gates of the town. A dozen samurai fell to his kanabo. His speed and strength were unmatched. His rage was incomprehensible. Covered in blood and gore, Kazan battled through the town and soon found the lord hiding in a villa. He dragged him out of a cabinet, sliced his tendons to immobilize him and watched him beg and squirm like a dog. Without hesitation, he thrust his fist into the lord’s mouth and yanked out the wicked tongue that had desecrated his name.<br><br>Satisfied, Kazan exited the villa to find himself surrounded by dozens of farmers wielding rusted scythes, sharp pitchforks, and heavy clubs. He survived the first few assaults, but there were too many attackers coming from every direction. Within moments Kazan was on the ground staring at a cold, indifferent, darkening sky as farmers took turns stabbing and torturing the ‘Oni’ who had butchered their beloved lord. The frenzied mob dragged Kazan into a small stone mill to continue the torture and finally left him to die a slow, agonizing death. When they returned, the mill was filled with a strange black fog and Kazan’s body and the kanabo were nowhere to be found. It was the beginning of a dark legend about a rageful Oni haunting the town.

Though they are weak and vulnerable, Survivors can use their small size to quickly vault through windows, leap over pallets, or find hiding spots. The Survivors have a wide third person perspective which gives them an advantage in situational awareness.

    He's lost. He doesn't know where he is. He sees things like tentacles reaching out for him from the fog and he knows they're not real. None of it is. He's losing his mind if he hasn't lost it already. His eyes play tricks on him. He sees giant, nameless creatures looming over him. Doesn't matter. They're not real. None of it is. His hunger confuses him. Oppresses him. He'd do anything for that feeling again. Anything. Even… return to the trials. He would. He'd rip survivors and killers apart limb from limb for that feeling again. He begins to mumble words. A promise… one flower… one flower… and I will do anything…

    Lisa Sherwood grew up in a quiet town. The people of the village were kind, and the elders helped settle their disputes and keep the old traditions alive. Lisa was particularly fond of the charms they taught her to draw for safety and good fortune. One night, as she was walking home through the woods, a terrible storm struck without warning. In the slick wet darkness, she lost her footing and struck her head. Slipping in and out of consciousness, she watched dark shapes approach between the trees. Soon they were close enough for her to make out their evil, hungry grins.<br><br>They kept her chained to the wall in a flooded cellar. Through the gloom, she could see others, whose open wounds swarmed with flies. They did not survive long once the cannibals began carving bites from their bodies with their rusted blades, but somehow Lisa persisted. Starved and mutilated, her gaunt arms became loose in their shackles. She pulled, and the metal tore through skin and muscle until she was free. Her flesh oozed viscous yellow pus and bones were visible beneath gangrenous wounds. She could go no further. Delirious, she thought of home; she thought of the elders. She traced the symbols they had taught her. A dark hunger stirred inside her. It yearned for blood. She chose vengeance.<br>The police search eventually brought them to the old house in the swamp. Its inhabitants had been dismembered and devoured. The elders’ charms were scrawled in blood on the floor. Lisa’s body was never found.<br>

    When she was five years old, Adiris, the youngest of a family of seven, was left on the brick-red burning steps of the Temple of Purgation at the center of Babylon. To process her shock and sorrow, she held onto the belief that the gods had a plan for her. Her new life was one of quiet servitude. She would tend to the gardens, prepare ceremonial meals, and polish ceremonial incense burners. At night, she would pray for a sign that would reveal her purpose.<br><br>When she came of age, she attended the high-ranking priests during the yearly worshiping of the sea-goat, the god of water and creation. Swinging a censer down the great hypostyle hall, she cast thick black fumes that reached the cold towering stone pillars before dissipating. Her worries lifted, and the resulting bliss made her feel closer to the gods than ever. She worked herself to the bone each day that followed, fulfilling her duties while taking on new ones, as she aided the priests during purification rituals.<br><br>The priests were more and more in need of assistance. Cleansings were being performed daily to answer the demand from outside the high temple walls, where a catastrophic plague had resurfaced. Within months, the priests contracted the disease. It did not take long before they became too weak to perform any kind of ritual. Adiris, having assisted many purification rituals, was the only one able to carry on. The swelling panic had to be contained, even if by a novice.<br><br>Anxious before her first ceremony, Adiris visited the priests’s sanctuary chamber. When she lit the candles, she noticed a narrow opening at the back. Sliding through the gap, she reached a crypt hidden under the sanctuary. The chamber was bare except for the golden statue of a woman, who stood with outstretched hands, her fingers covered in jewels. It was the sign Adiris had been waiting for.<br><br>The great hall was packed with followers who bowed down as Adiris entered. She strode to the brick altar and grabbed a ceremonial dagger forged in silver, her ruby ringed fingers wrapping around the blade like claws. The sudden display of luxury intrigued the followers, who were struck already by her youth and beauty.<br><br>As she began reciting the epic of creation, a woman at the back swooned and collapsed. Adiris rushed to her and noticed the black blisters covering her feet. Without hesitation, Adiris grabbed her sacred blade and swung it at her own foot, severing a toe. Then she offered the bloody part to the gods, asking them to protect the woman.  A silence fell over the followers, who revered Adiris as their new priestess.<br><br>Tales of her wealth, beauty, and devotion began to spread across the city as quickly as the disease.  Soon, Adiris’s followers called her the High Priestess of Babylon.<br><br>But her faith was tried when she showed the first signs of infection; her cough became a mix of phlegm and blood, her neck erupted in abscesses, and her four-toed foot darkened. Ashamed of her condition, she began wearing a veiled headpiece and carried a censer that masked the rancid smell of sick that clang to her skin. Hoping to be saved, she kept performing the rituals, offering blessed water and food to her followers.<br><br>But no ritual could save her. In a desperate attempt to appease the gods, Adiris banished herself from the city. She traveled north with a few followers, venturing through the cold woodlands of Urashtu, until it was no longer possible to walk.<br><br>They camped in a damp cave, where Adiris lay in a pool of vomit. Her foot, which had turned black, was so swollen she could not go any further. Her followers and she realized the truth in that cave: they were all infected with the plague.<br><br>Kneeling among her retching followers, Adiris made one last prayer. The black fumes of incense rose into the damp air before being wiped off by a cold breeze.<br><br>Neither the body of Adiris nor her followers were ever found. Many told tales of her return, but no one truly knew what fate had befallen the High Priestess of Babylon.

    Rin was the only child of the Yamaoka family. She was raised in the dusty halls of a traditional house in Kagawa. She studied Education at Takamatsu, a private university, which weighed heavily on her family’s shaky finances. Her mother got ill that year and the bills started piling up. Rin worked part-time in a futile attempt to help lighten the load.<br><br>Her father faced a debt that grew without end. He started working double-shifts in hopes of obtaining a promotion. That’s when he started losing sleep. A dark whisper would keep him awake all night, reminding him of his hopeless situation. Exhausted, he started to lose grasp of reality. Fighting to deny what the voice whispered at night, Rin’s father made a desperate move. He met with his superior and explained his situation. He begged for a bonus, an advance, time-off---anything.<br><br>His request was denied. The company had launched a defective production line that was costing them dearly. Someone had to be held accountable and Rin’s father fitted the bill perfectly. He was fired after twenty-two years of service.<br><br>That evening, Rin came home from work. She’d stayed late to entertain customers that lingered at the restaurant. As she parked her bike in the shed, she heard her mother’s scream from the house.<br><br>She rushed in, climbing up the stairs to her parents’ room. There she found bits and pieces of her mother on the floor. Her limbs were clean-cut, tangled up in an unnatural position. Her breasts were sliced up, revealing her rib cage, which was cracked open. Rin gagged.<br><br>A sharp katana came crashing down. Rin blocked the blade, which bit into her bare forearm. The shock of recognition interrupted her pain: her father was wielding the katana with a stoic expression. She cried out to make him stop, but he slashed her arm again.<br><br>She rushed off and slid on the blood-smeared floor. Using the doorframe as support, she raised herself up. The katana ripped through the wall, cleaving her other arm. She screamed in pain as she limped into the hallway, only to be met by her father’s blade.<br><br>She stepped back, trembling, as she held together the soft loose flesh of her abdomen. Images of her mother’s tangled limbs flashed before her eyes.<br><br>Rin charged at her father, making him stumble back. He punched her torn abdomen and she reclined in pain. As she struggled to get back up, he slashed her thigh, making her collapse on the floor.<br><br>As she crawled towards the stairs, he grabbed her hair and yanked her against a partition. The glass shattered on impact and she fell through, landing one floor down.<br><br>She heard footsteps somewhere above her. With effort, she moved, worming her way into a sea of broken glass. The shards gnawed at her, ripping her flesh. He had to be stopped. He would not get away with what he’d done to her—with what he’d done to her mother.<br><br>Coughing up blood, her chin grazed the glass, adding to the bleeding. A low-pitched heartbeat started to ring in her ears. Her body felt so heavy she could no longer move.<br><br>The ground shook with her father’s footsteps. She knew she was not going to make it, but she no longer cared. She would make him pay, in this life or the next.<br><br>A dark Fog slowly veiled her eyes, but it could not subdue her rage. She would not rest—not yet. The darkness whispered, promising blood and revenge.<br><br>An oath was made and Rin closed her eyes.

    All planes of existence are a unique mix of conscious Auric particles and material particles. The Entity is almost certainly pure consciousness… The observable fact of existence is the material world responds to and changes with consciousness… collective consciousness is the key… The body, the home, the trial—all of it is an expression of The Entity's unconscious need for fear and terror.<br><br>The distinct observation in the specimens chosen by The Entity is that they all come from worlds that have failed to understand the metaphysical relationship between their thoughts and the world they live in. This is not by chance. It is, to my mind, self-preservation. Victims who know this truth and have honed their ability to manifest could be poisonous to The Entity.  This leads me to believe The Entity is attracted to dark worlds because darkness and chaos are clear indicators that inhabitants have failed to connect the dots between the collective consciousness and the health of their world. The conclusion, then, might be that The Entity feeds off ignorance.

    This is not the Badham Preschool where children laughed and learned, made lifelong friendships and had their paintings hung on the walls. This is a dark echo created from the nightmares of those who suffered there. The walls creak under the burden of history. Events that should be long forgotten are recorded forever in the plaster and stone, pervading the building with misery. Only one part of the building is accurately reflected in this darkness. The squalid room where Freddy Krueger lived and worked. The hidden basement area where he committed the heinous acts that appalled a town and condemned him to death. This is a place of the subconscious, of the nightmare brought into hideous reality.

    Kenneth Chase was born in 1932 by a difficult labor, which his mother wouldn’t survive. This event drove a rift between him and his father that never closed. As the boy grew, so did his father’s resentment, and his drinking habit. By the time Kenneth was at school, they lived mostly separate lives.<br><br>Academically, he was unremarkable, coasting by on his significant athletic prowess. He grew tall and strong, excelling at track events, but shunned any attempts to coax him into team sports.<br><br>On his walk home from school, he would often find feathers on the ground and he soon began a collection, keeping them in a cigar box under his bed. With his father either at work or in an alcohol-induced stupor, Kenneth had hours to spend alone, transfixed by the regularity of the feathers’ barbs and feeling the softness as he ran them over his lips. Watching the birds that came to the feeder in his garden, he imagined how soft they must be and resolved to catch one. He ingratiated himself with the local dentist, soon procuring some anesthetic. Using this, he rigged up a trap on the feeder, that he hoped would knock out a bird long enough that he could touch it.<br><br>After a few failed attempts, he managed to trap a robin. As it lay in his hand, he felt a sudden rush, of a life at his mercy. He had planned to release it once it recovered from the anesthetic. Instead, as its eyes flickered back into consciousness and it began to struggle, his grip remained firm. His fingers slowly tightened around its throat, squeezing until its chest feathers were finally still. He disposed of the body, keeping just a feather, with which he started a new collection, discarding the others as ‘fake’.<br><br>By the late 1940s, Kenneth had left school and started working as a busboy at a local diner. He had also escalated to larger prey, like squirrels, raccoons and dogs, becoming skilled at customizing the anesthetic dosage for each.<br><br>In early 1954, a young man went missing and the town was turned upside down in the search. A few months later, Kenneth’s father, while doing some work in the crawlspace under the house, found a cigar box. He broke it open and saw, to his horror, that it contained feathers, animal paws, and a man’s finger.<br><br>Returning from work, Kenneth saw his father leaving the crawlspace with a cigar box in his hands. He turned on his heel and never went home again.<br><br>After a few weeks of living rough, he encountered a traveling circus and, with his prodigious strength, was hired to work the ropes. He assumed a new name: Jeffrey Hawk.<br><br>Suddenly surrounded by a close-knit community, “Jeffrey” had to learn to socialize. He donned a new personality like a disguise, quickly becoming known as charming and helpful, and was welcomed into his new family.<br><br>Over the next decade, he stayed with the circus, traveling the length and breadth of the USA. But, with the itinerant life providing few repercussions, he fell into bad habits. Drink, junk food, drugs, he indulged all of them to excess. For a time, these vices were enough, but then his old urges returned and his nomadic existence became a cover for him to resume killing. He stole clothes and makeup from performers, fashioning a disguise that would let him get close to his victims before he anesthetized them, bringing them back to his caravan, where they would awake to find themselves bound and at his mercy. He would finally get to have his fun, mentally and physically torturing them, their screams fueling him, before being lost in the night.<br><br>Once their strength was at its lowest, he would carefully examine their fingers, searching for the prettiest, running them over his tongue to find the tastiest. Once he found the best, he would cut it from their hand and proudly add it to his collection, disposing of the rest of the body as pointless waste.<br><br>Men, women, young, old, he didn’t care. The essence of a good collection is in the variety, in the memories and stories they evoke.<br><br>He removed the costume less and less, shedding his old personality with it, fully embracing the clown, his true self.<br><br>With time, he became complacent and sloppy. A victim managed to work free of her bindings while he was sleeping off the drink. She escaped, screaming for help, and he awoke to find the rest of the circus bearing down on him. He whipped his horse and the caravan disappeared into the night.<br><br>Since then he has roamed the country, a parasite who could always be found at a carnival or circus, but who would never been seen on any playbill. He lured those brave, or foolish, enough to come near, trapped them and moved on before they could be found missing.<br><br>Somewhere along the way, he left the ordinary roads of the USA behind him, traveling through a veil of mist and entering a new realm. It was a place of transience and impermanence, perfectly suiting the life he had chosen to lead. Feeling more at home than he had in his entire life, he set up camp and waited for his first visitor.

    Fog Whisperers
    The single child of a wealthy family, David King seemed destined for greatness. While growing up in Manchester, he demonstrated serious potential in both sports and academics, and with his family connections, all doors were open to him. He could have succeeded at anything, if it weren't for his combative nature. David lived for the adrenaline rush of a good fight and would go out of his way to get into one.<br><br>His robustness and athletic abilities led him to rugby, where he could cut loose and really cause a ruckus. King excelled and gained a reputation as a promising, if somewhat reckless, rookie. His meteoric rise came to an abrupt end when he lost his temper and assaulted a referee, earning himself a lifetime ban from the league and cutting short what most people assumed was going to be a long, successful career. King was unconcerned; money was no issue, so he took it as an early retirement and focused on other fun things to do.<br><br>Free from the constraints of a career and enabled by the wealth of his family, David King spent most of his time at the pub, drinking, watching games, and getting into fights. Some might say he was wasting his life away. Not many people knew that he was an occasional "debt collector" or that he fought in clandestine bare-knuckle fight clubs.<br><br>When David King stopped showing up at the pub, the few friends he still had were not surprised. They figured he had finally picked a fight with someone stronger than he was. In a way, they were right.

    Deadly Race
    When Survivors are located by the Killer, they'll usually attempt to run and hide. The pursuit that follows is called <b>the chase</b>.<br><br>Most Killers are faster than a Survivor, but Survivors are small, nimble, and have many tricks they can use to gain distance, put obstacles in the Killer's way and break line of sight.<br><br>The Killer's goal is to keep track of the fleeing Survivor and get close enough to land a devastating hit. The chase ends when the Survivor gets far enough away from the Killer, or the Killer incapacitates the Survivor.

    Killers should be aware of the methods Survivors can use to locate them. Most Killers are very large, making them quite easy to see, but there are some other aspects to Survivor perception that are important to keep in mind:<br><br><b>Third Person View:</b> The Survivors have a wide third person perspective. The Survivor player is able to see behind their character and around corners.<br><br><b>Terror Radius:</b> Survivors hear a heartbeat when the Killer approaches. The closer the Killer is, the more intense the heartbeat.<br><br><b>The Stain:</b> Survivors can see an eerie red light emitted in front of the Killer. The stain can give away the Killer's position as well as the direction in which they are looking.<br><br><i>Consult <b>"The Survivors"</b> section of this guide to learn more about the Survivors' abilities.</i>

    One of Kate Denson’s earliest memories was standing in front of her family, singing a song that she’d learned that morning at school, and watching smiles spread across their faces. Seeing how something as simple as a song could make people so happy was the moment when she knew what she wanted to do with her life.<br><br>She practised, learned the guitar as soon as she was big enough to reach over it, and was performing in front of crowds by the time she was eight years old. Her mother did everything she could to fulfil Kate’s dreams, taking her all over home state of Pennsylvania, then across the South, and even to Nashville itself.<br><br>Kate won folk music competitions and talent shows whenever she participated, but for her to win others had to lose, and that wasn’t in her nature. She only wanted an outlet, a way to touch people’s lives. To make them forget the worries of the world and just enjoy themselves, if only for a while.<br><br>With age came a new-found freedom. She bought a battered old Chevy truck and was able to travel around by herself, meeting fans and making new friends wherever she stopped. Hers wasn’t a story of rock excess though: just the road, her guitar and maybe a good bourbon to end the day.<br><br>From sun-baked festivals to dark and cosy bars, people flocked to her voice and her self-penned songs of friendship, family, love and home.<br><br>These sentiments weren’t just lip-service: she made sure to return home as often as she could, to help out in her community and entertain the local children with her tales of the wider world. She saw it as a way of giving back, of supporting others in the same way she had.<br><br>It was home where she found most of her inspiration as well. She had always loved to take long walks in the woods around her town, exploring off the beaten track, finding a quiet spot to play and write her songs. She had a favorite location she returned to time and again, a natural hollow, encircled by trees, that looked almost as if it had been blasted out of the rocks thousands of years ago.<br><br>Here she felt a strong connection to nature, and to the Earth itself. She let her mind be enveloped by the forest and it rewarded her with constant inspiration.<br><br>She picked up her guitar and played, her fingers dancing across the fretboard. The music that she made this time was unlike her usual uplifting tunes, being much more melancholy, even dark. Still, something compelled her to continue, to finish the song.<br><br>Around her, the leaves vibrated in unison with the guitar strings and the boughs of the trees lengthened, coalescing into a living form. Spider-like legs descended from the canopy above, grasping for her. Regaining her senses, she grabbed a rock and tried to beat them back, but their skin was as hard as iron and the rock simply bounced off and skittered away.<br><br>The legs coiled like tendrils around her limbs and lifted her towards the darkness overhead. Fog rolled across the clearing, obscuring both Kate and the creature of nightmares that drew her up towards itself.<br><br>When the fog cleared, there was no sign of any struggle, or of life. Just an acoustic guitar, the scratch plate engraved with flowers; as well as the initials KD, inlaid in mother of pearl.

    When he heard that Nancy’s mother had disappeared, Quentin Smith knew instantly that their success had been short-lived. Although their plan had seemed to work flawlessly, Freddy Krueger had beaten death yet again.<br><br>But Quentin wasn’t about to give up. It might take many attempts, but he vowed that somehow he would find a way to beat Freddy, once and for all. If he didn’t, it would only be a matter of time before Freddy would win and Nancy was lost.<br><br>Someone like Quentin never attracted attention in a library, no matter how strange the texts he requested were. He devoured all the information he could, on shared dream worlds, lucid dreaming, and the methods to control the dream space. Forcing himself to stay awake, via a steady diet of pills and energy drinks, he searched through dusty volumes, finding myths about the demons that live in dreams, trapping their victims in limbo and feeding off their terror. <br><br>He worked quickly as he knew that Freddy would soon be coming for him.<br><br>It wasn’t long before that moment arrived and Freddy began appearing in his dreams. He stayed at the periphery at first, taunting Quentin, seemingly hoping to tire him out. Using all that he had learned, Quentin was able to see flaws in the dream; cracks where escape routes could be formed. He tested this skill carefully, not wanting to show his hand, hoping that it would give him some kind of advantage that he could use to defeat Freddy. <br><br>Then, one night, he found himself in the familiar environment of Badham Preschool. Freddy had tired of the taunting and had finally decided to gut him.<br><br>Quentin ran through the school, his quick eyes scanning for something useful in the maze of rooms. He found a can of paint thinner and quickly formulated a plan. <br><br>Once the trap was set, he waited, acting as the lure to draw Freddy into the right position. And there he was, claws scraping on metal as he closed in for the kill. <br><br>Quentin allowed himself time to enjoy the surprise on Freddy’s face as the corridor ignited and then he was away, running through the building, heading for the exit that he knew existed. If he harried Freddy, weakening him and then escaping the dream to safety, surely that would defeat him over time?<br><br>Before his eyes, the cracks in the dream closed and his escape route was blocked. He was in Freddy’s secret room again, and there was nowhere to run.<br><br>As Freddy closed in, a broad grin spreading across his ruined face, Quentin was consumed by a need to see this man finally obliterated. He wished it had been him, not his father, who threw the gas can that ended Krueger’s life, that it had been him who cut Freddy’s throat. Perhaps that desire would be enough? This was a realm of the mind after all. <br><br>He let it consume him, concentrating all his thoughts on wishing Freddy gone.<br><br>His vision was obscured with roiling tendrils of fog and, when it cleared, he was somewhere else. In another dream? If so, it wasn’t his; it felt cold and unfamiliar.<br><br>A flickering drew his attention and he realized he was by a campfire, and he wasn’t alone. Other people were trapped here too, and they needed his help.

    Adam was born in Rollington Town in Kingston, Jamaica. His father died in a car accident when he was two, and his uncle took him in. His uncle was a strict, but fair man, who raised him to value education.<br><br>At Kingston College, Adam discovered his father’s published works, which triggered his passion for literature. His campus, however, was known for its focus on athletics. As a shy teenager with his nose stuck in books, he was the perfect prey for bullies. What he lacked in sports, he made up in grit. He learned to defend himself in the thick of it.<br><br>It’s during his years in college that he started to imagine his life elsewhere. While his close friends orbited the music industry, he followed a surer path. His grades granted him admission to higher education, and there was a demand for teachers abroad.<br><br>After graduating university, he taught extra classes to afford applying fees overseas. He had a steady diet of long commutes, grading piles, nightly lesson plans, and early classes. After a year, he managed to apply for a position abroad. His first plane ride took him to Southern Japan for a new start.<br><br>His life in Kagoshima was hectic. There was little time to do everything he took for granted back home. His Japanese was elementary at best, which slowed him down. Buying groceries took hours, long commutes had to be planned, and lesson plans relied on Japanese notions, which he had to learn.<br><br>But after a few months, he found his rhythm. He reflected on it one morning while riding the train to work. He no longer had to study the kanji characters filling the map. He knew his way. His language skills had improved, he felt connected to his students, and he’d treat himself to luxurious restaurants on weekends. He even had his first vacation planned.<br><br>Within seconds, Adam’s world was brought down to a slow motion. Rails hissed, bags came pouring down, and the floor trembled before the hit: Adam crashed forward as the train flipped upside down. He landed on a window pane as an unhinged door came flying at a passenger. He rolled over so that the door would hit him instead of the girl. He shut his eyes as he braced for impact, but nothing happened.<br><br>He squinted one eye open and he saw nothing but darkness. A heavy Fog had taken over the train. Ice seemed to flow through his body, reaching his lips first, then the tip of his fingers before spreading to his legs. Lulled by the warm hum of the dark whisper, he closed his eyes, drifting.<br><br>No one truly knows what happened to Adam Francis. The school teachers imagined the worst when they watched the train derailment on the news and saw he was missing. Their fears seemed to be confirmed when Adam’s bag was recovered from the crash site, but his body was never found. To this day, his uncle believes that Adam took off after the train crash, alive still, somewhere out there.

    Detective David Tapp was one of the good guys. His determination to see Killers brought to justice and their victims avenged had led him through a long and respected career.<br><br>When he first saw the details of the Jigsaw case, it seemed like many others. More grisly and macabre, sure, but just another lunatic with a penchant for the over-dramatic, who would soon be behind bars.<br><br>A stroke of insight brought Tapp, and his partner Detective Stephen Sing, to an abandoned mannequin factory, where they discovered Jigsaw’s lair. They apprehended the man but he managed to escape before being unmasked, slashing Tapp’s throat as he did so.<br><br>Leaving his partner, Sing went in pursuit, but fell victim to a booby trap.<br><br>Tapp had failed to go by the book on this one occasion, entering the lair without a warrant, and it had resulted in a Detective’s death. He was discharged from the force and left with a ruined throat and crippling guilt.<br><br>He channeled that guilt into an obsession: he would find the Killer, stop the murders, vindicate himself, and avenge his friend and colleague. Following the evidence trail brought him to Dr Lawrence Gordon and he staked out the doctor’s apartment, sure that he would find some evidence of guilt.<br><br>Then he saw a stranger at Gordon’s window, and heard gunshots. Tapp confronted him and the man fled, with the pursuit leading to an industrial building.<br><br>Tapp’s age caught up with him, A fight that he would easily have won in his younger days ended with Tapp taking a bullet to the chest. Slumping to the floor, he saw only failure. He had failed his partner, and the other victims. Whoever the Killer was, Tapp had been unable to stop him. More would die and it would be his fault.<br><br>He let the rage and guilt consume him and closed his eyes for the final time. Beneath him, the concrete floor softened. He dug his fingers into the ground, feeling dirt and leaves. Where his chest had been wet with blood, the shirt was now dry and the pain had gone. His eyes opened onto a darkened sky and the jagged, searching fingers of branches.<br><br>Screams echoed through the forest and a new determination filled him. His mind was clear for the first time in months. Victims needed to be avenged, Killers thwarted. He didn’t know what this place was, but he was still a cop, and he always would be. He had a job to do.

    The son of wealthy landowners Max and Evelyn Thompson, this unnamed boy was an unwanted child born to savage parents. Hideously disfigured, he was shut away from society. So ashamed they were of their son, they bricked him into a room and fed him through a hole in the wall. When the boy escaped, he took his revenge savagely and terribly, slaughtering the parents who had tortured him instead of raising him.<br><br>After the deed was done, he continued to live his life at the farm, taking out his deranged violence on the animals that were allowed to run free. As he finally broke free from his shackles, he ran through the cornfields, chasing and slaughtering whatever he could find. They never found the bodies of Max and Evelyn, but they did find tortured and disemboweled animals, all over the farm. Coldwind Farm was quickly settled and the land split up and sold off. There was never a buyer for the farmhouse. Perhaps because of that sound of a chainsaw you could hear throughout those hot summer nights.<br>

But he senses that to know… to really know would drive him… mad. Madness. That's what this place is. The embodiment of madness. He doesn't want to be pulled into another trial. He wants to return home. He must return home. That's why he was studying the serum. It gave him insight. Insight to what? He doesn't remember.

    Oblivious
    Even while he lived, Freddy Krueger was a creature of nightmare for those who truly knew him. Hiding behind a mask of warmth and friendliness, Freddy’s actual temperament was known only to his victims. When those victims were finally heard, the parents of Springwood tracked Freddy down and took the law into their own hands. They thought fire had rid them of a monster that night, that their children were finally safe, but evil as strong as his has a way of surviving. <br>Years passed, the horror was buried, the victims mercifully forgot. Then, somehow, Freddy returned, and dreams became nightmares once again.<br>Freddy focused his anger on those he felt had wronged him, building up to his one true obsession: Nancy Holbrook. But he underestimated her strength and resourcefulness. Together with her friend, Quentin, she managed to weaken Freddy, mutilating him and leaving him for dead once more. <br>Death didn’t want Freddy the first time he encountered it, why did they think it would take him now? He emerged once more, consumed with vengeance. Then he turned his sights on the boy who had blocked his path to Nancy, his number one. <br>Freddy invaded Quentin’s dreams, terrorising him night after night, until his strength and defences would be at their lowest. When the time was right, he forced the boy to return to the dark reflection of Badham Preschool. Here he would have his final revenge.<br>Freddy stalked the boy through the school’s halls. He took his time, savoring every moment of the hunt. This was what he enjoyed the most: the smell of their sweat in the air, the ragged gasps of their terrified breath. They were his to play with. <br>There was the boy, at the end of a long corridor. Too tired and scared to run anymore? Resigned to his fate? Freddy closed in, arms wide, claws raking the wall. Their tips traced along a pipe, the metallic shrieking only adding to the boy’s apprehension.<br>A shower of sparks rained on the ground, and into the liquid that covered the tiled floor. A blue flame blossomed and quickly engulfed the room.<br>The boy took flight as Freddy burst from the flames in a fury. Rooms and walls raced past in a blur until they were in Freddy’s basement. There would be no escape from here.<br>Slowly Freddy closed in on the boy. His fear was so strong now that Freddy could almost taste it, but his eyes burned with a defiant hatred that was almost admirable. <br>Freddy drew back his claws.<br>Then Freddy felt another presence with him; something old, powerful and dark. A miasma enveloped him and the only sensation was a sound like wooden beams flexing and creaking in the distance. The echoing groan of metal crushed against metal. Something arcane and unknowable, half-way between language and pure terror. <br>There was a moment of falling and spinning, and then Freddy was back in the school. But not his school. It looked the same, but it felt different. His powers were tempered in some ways and focused in others. The boy had gone for now, but other prey walked the hallways. Some would be inconsequential; others would become his new favorites. All would fall before his claws.

    Loose fitting, formal pants paired with sleek black loafers.
    A blooming mouth full of needle-like teeth for a face, large, curved, razor-sharp claws, and powerful legs to pounce on victims, make The Demogorgon a frightening monster to face in any dimension. It is a nightmare of unrestrained, feral rage as it hunts down its prey and rips it to pieces, devouring every last morsel of flesh and gore, leaving nothing for scavengers. The creature is untouched by any sense of compassion or restraint. Looming over its victim, it shows no doubt or mercy, just the pure instinct of its insatiable bloodlust as it delivers the deathblow. A perfect hunter, The Demogorgon is a macabre testament to the horrors lurking in the Upside Down and why it was choice pickings for The Entity.

    Embrace the immense unknown and surrender yourself to the vast inexplicable: that is the oath of the faithful. When surrounded by darkness, they look inward for a beacon of light to follow, trusting it will lead them to safety. But when their light is distorted by pride and ambition, how long will they err in the dark?<br><br>Sold to a Babylonian temple as a child, she sought the means to repel the darkness she carried inside. She found solace in sacred rituals, where she felt safe and empowered. Faithful but proud, she began to rise in status and believed she was untouchable. But when a plague began to defile her body, she confronted her gods, realizing too late that they had no impact on her fate.<br><br>Jane Romero was striving to become a powerful icon, a voice that would inspire and support those in need. She fought against powerful executives to send out her message about owning up to your insecurities. Her goal was to release people from the painful experiences that plagued their chances at a successful future. Every day she would share her beliefs and practices with thousands of avid followers. Adding to her success was the growing pressure from the media to fit the mold, and a difficult past that weighted on her shoulders, which made her question her legitimacy. One evening, she was driving home after a particularly stressful live show, and feeling drained, she closed her eyes for a moment that had lasting consequences.

And one day Andrew’s foreman had to pay Sally a visit, forever changing her life. With no other option, Sally had to find a way but the only employment she could get was at the Crotus Prenn Asylum. She started at the bottom, doing the hard night shift. Over the years, her mind had reached its limits, decades of seeing horrid things that violate the eyes. Finally, she could not take it anymore and concepts of purification emerged inside her. As the morning staff arrived one day in September - they found over fifty dead patients in their bed along 4 staff members, also dead. Only Sally had survived the night but her mind was gone, rocking back and forth non-stop. They got her into an ambulance, but that ambulance never reached the hospital.

    As soon as Anna was able to walk, her mother started teaching her how to survive a harsh, solitary life in the northern woods. Living in such an extremely remote and dangerous area required skill and resilience. When sunlight became too dim for productive activities, they would take refuge in their house, a sturdy old cabin constructed to resist the toughest winters. Close to the hearth’s warmth, Anna would rest in her mother’s arms, surrounded by the few wooden toys and masks she had crafted for her. Drifting off to sleep with stories and lullabies, she dreamt happy dreams, ignorant of the events that would soon change everything.<br><br>Anna and her mother were stalking a great elk through the woods. They knew it was dangerous prey, but it had been a particularly difficult winter and they were almost out of food. The specter of starvation frightened them more than any forest creature. Without warning, the elk reared, bellowed and charged at Anna. She was paralyzed with fear as the whole world seemed to shake under the immense beast's pounding hooves. The elk was close enough for Anna to see the murderous fury in its eyes when her mother threw herself in its path, axe in hand. A bloodcurdling scream escaped from her lips as the elk impaled her upon its antlers and hoisted her into the air. With all her strength, she brought her axe down on its head again and again while it tried to shake her loose. With a sickening crack, the antlers snapped and Anna's mother was free. The beast collapsed.<br><br>Anna was too small to move her mother's broken body, so she sat with her in the clearing where she had fallen. To distract her from the dying elk's cries, Anna's mother held her and hummed her favorite lullaby. They stayed like that, the huntress and the elk getting quieter and colder, until Anna was alone in the silent forest. Eventually she stood up and started the long walk back home.<br><br>Still a child, she knew just enough about life in the frozen forest to survive. She followed her instincts and became one with the wild. She got older and stronger and practiced her hunt. As she grew into a dangerous predator, her humanity became a half-remembered dream.<br><br>She widened her territory and lived off her hunts. She worked her way up through squirrels and hares and mink and foxes. Eventually she grew tired of them and hunted more dangerous animals like wolves and bears. When unsuspecting travelers came through her woods, she discovered her new favorite prey: humans. Unlucky souls who strayed into her territory were slaughtered like any other animal. She liked to collect their tools and colorful garments and especially toys when there were little ones. But she could never bring herself to kill the little girls.<br><br>Girls she would take back to her house, deep in the woods. They were precious, and looking at them woke up something deep in her heart. She craved the closeness of a loved one, a child of her own. Among the pillaged wooden toys, dolls and story books she couldn’t read, the girls would be tied by the neck with a rough and chafing rope fastened firmly to the wall. She couldn’t let them wander off, or they would surely die outside.<br><br>Every time, the girls would waste away and die of cold or starvation or sickness. Every time, it plunged Anna deeper into pain and sorrow and madness. She was compelled to try again, and started raiding the nearest villages to slaughter families and kidnap their daughters. She wore one of the animal masks her mother crafted for her so many years earlier to try to calm the frightened children. Villagers spread the legend of a half-beast lurking in Red Forest: The Huntress, who killed men and ate little girls.<br><br>War eventually came to the forest. German soldiers began to pass through, on the march to attack the collapsing Russian Empire. During these dark times, there were no more travelers. The villagers had abandoned their homes, and no more little ones to be found; only soldiers. Many of them were found with violent axe wounds. Whole groups disappeared mysteriously. Once the war was over, the rumours of The Huntress disappeared with it, engulfed by the Red Forest.

    Feng Min was a young girl when she first picked up computer games, and she was instantly hooked. Her parents saw no wrong with a few minutes in front of the screen, but as minutes turned into hours and sometimes days, they finally decided to pull the plug and force Feng Min to put more efforts into her studies.<br><br>She felt smothered by parents, so she left home and spent her time in internet cafés and LAN parties where the old rules didn’t apply. She spent hours playing, streaming, competing to rise to the top. In the gaming world, she finally found respect. Nicknamed the “Shining Lion,” she was invited to join a prestigious e-sports team where she found a sanctuary free of the misconceptions and prejudice she had felt from her parents and the non-gaming world.<br><br>Feng Min pushed her limits to prove she was the best. Sleep was less important to her than training. She pushed herself too far, slept too little, and her performance began to slip. She started to lose. At night, she would stay up, tormented by the thought of disappointing her parents… and her fans. She spiraled out of control and fell into a pattern of self-destruction. She started wandering the streets and visiting bars, waking up in places she didn’t remember. One day she woke up somewhere completely different…
    The half-forgotten, temple complex dedicated to the cleansing of the High Priestess’s followers. The vertiginous hypostyle hall was believed to hold the weight of the heavens.<br>Stolen from the memories of The Plague, the temple was planted in the howling Red Forest, whose winds eroded its smooth edges. It now stands as a beacon of fear, visible from all cardinal points.

    What does it mean to be authentic? How does one follow one’s destiny despite the pressures of family and tradition? Often following one‘s path is a strenuous, narrow struggle full of unexpected joys and difficulties. Ultimately it’s about finding the balance between tradition and self-actualization. But as one struggles for identity, decisions are made and consequences, good or bad, must be faced.

Heir to a famous Japanese swordsmanship school, Kazan Yamaoka sought to surpass his reputation as a warrior by turning his back on honor and family and embarking on a dark pilgrimage of bloodlust. As he waged his personal war against self-proclaimed samurai, he was bestowed with the derogatory and despised nickname of Oni-Yamaoka, a reference to the hideous creature of legend. One day, he met his fate as his former victims took revenge on him. It drew the Entity’s attention and he was deemed worthy of becoming part of its world, joining the other killers there, but ironically under the very form he had been compared to in his former life.

Quick, daring and superstitious, Yui Kimura was one of the youngest motorcyclists to break records in unsanctioned street races as well as the very prestigious Moto Grand Prix of Japan. Breaking with tradition and against her parents’ wishes, she left her home to pursue her dreams of racing and led a gang helping women in troubled situations. Until she found herself roped into another endless race where crossing the finish line was a matter of life and death.

    The Office is where money changed owners and hands were shook. The heavy duty safe in the floor might have been a dead giveaway to the shady business that took place. Wads of cash were hidden all over the place. Stating that money wasn’t an issue, maybe people got executed for enjoyment, rather than wealth.

    Another way for Killers to track Survivors is by following the bloodstains that they leave behind while injured or dying. Bloodstains are harder to see than scratch marks, but are more accurate and a Survivor cannot stop bleeding until they heal. Blood in front of a locker, for example, is a dead giveaway. Like the scratch marks, bloodstains will disappear after a few seconds.

    Claudette knows she's not like other kids and she doesn't have to be. Things like ‘bell curves' and ‘ideal student' don't apply to her and that's okay. The ideal mold is a prison for those wired differently and her teacher has set her free.  Her grades are getting better and a test is coming. She writes, visualizes, and imagines everything she needs to remember and somehow this works. The right teacher at the right time can make all the difference.<br><br>Her parents are proud. Very proud. But still her mother wishes she had friends. Still her mother wishes she liked what other girls liked. Her parents argue in another room about what to get for her birthday. Her mother wants to buy a new doll. Her father thinks she'd like something more related to bugs, plants and bacteria. The suggestion upsets her mother. He father defends her. See her for who she is and not who you want her to be!<br><br>Her mother goes silent. She suddenly releases a cry and says she doesn't want her to be bullied like she was bullied throughout school. Claudette's eyes go wide. For the first time in her life… she realizes… her mother's wired differently, too.

    Claudette is seven years old and feels alone. Very alone. Yes, her parents love her. Yes, they want the world for her. But the world doesn't want her. Or, at least, that's what Claudette believes. She just wants to fit in. Fit in at school. Fit in with her cousins. Fit in with her teammates on the soccer pitch. But fitting in isn't as simple as being like others. She's different and she knows it.<br><br>She feels slow. Unresponsive. Not quick enough to understand her teacher or keep up with her class.  The librarian calls her ‘addle minded.' When she talks, she stutters. Sometimes she loses her breath and has trouble recognizing when she's talking too loudly. But most of all her teacher embarrasses her. Says she's in the clouds. Always in the clouds. Get out of the clouds, Claudette! But she can't help it. She's exploring massive gardens and colorful bugs on strange new worlds.

    The first step to complete in order to escape is to repair the 5 generators. There are a few things to keep in mind while doing so:<br><br><b>Generator Locations:</b> Generator locations are randomly selected before the trial, so they cannot simply be memorized. To find the generators, Survivors can try looking out for the flashing lights above them or listen out for the sounds of partially repaired generators.<br><br><b>Killer Patrols:</b> Killers can see the auras of unrepaired and partially repaired generators. When not engaged in a chase, Killers will often patrol the generators searching for Survivors. <br><br><b>Skill Checks:</b> Survivors should be listening out for the Skill Check audio cue while repairing generators. Failing a Skill Check will cause the generator to explode, which sets back the repair progress and alerts the Killer.<br><br><b>Careful Repairs:</b> Repairing a generator takes time and makes noise that can attract the Killer; Survivors need to be on their guard. It's a good idea to plan one or more escape routes in case the Killer approaches.<br><br><b>The Escape:</b> Once the <b>5</b> generators have been repaired, a level-wide siren will alert all players that the Exit Gates can be opened. Survivors will only be shown the exit locations for a limited time, so they will need to remember where they are. Many Survivors have been caught at the end of a trial searching the perimeter for the exit!<br><br>If the <b>Endgame Collapse</b> is triggered before all Generators are repaired then they will become blocked off by the Entity.

    Some humans are simply bad seeds. Seeds infused with a distilled and pure form of evil. Michael Myers is one of those seeds. He had no issues with causing the pain of others. Instead, it was exactly what he sought. But even life can be tough on those with minds filled with terror. The difference is just how one goes about to solve those problems.<br><br>For Michael, he had to kill to find some inner peace. As he took his sister’s life, the police found a silent boy dressed as a clown at the scene. When one stumbles upon a growing fire, one does not pour gasoline on it. But this was an action taken by officials that had no idea how it would shape this demon in the boy’s body. Sending Michael to a mental institution was a feeble attempt to save the child. Unsuccessful therapy and nightly screams just made him even more introvert and deranged. People hoped that Michael Myers would end up a parenthesis, soon to be forgotten and buried, a failure that soon were to rot away. But then…he escaped.<br>

    This is not the Badham Preschool where children laughed and learned, made lifelong friendships and had their paintings hung on the walls. This is a dark echo created from the nightmares of those who suffered there. The walls creak under the burden of history. Events that should be long forgotten are recorded forever in the plaster and stone, pervading the building with misery. Only one part of the building is accurately reflected in this darkness. The squalid room where Freddy Krueger lived and worked. The hidden basement area where he committed the heinous acts that appalled a town and condemned him to death. This is a place of the subconscious, of the nightmare brought into hideous reality.

    Claudette is happy because her new teacher is helping her. Really helping her. She's learning new things every day. More than facts and vocabulary she's learning how to learn. Or rather, she's learning how she learns and that is the key. But her teacher is doing something else.  Her teacher is talking to her. She's talking to her about her ‘issue' and how her ‘issue' is really a blessing in disguise if she can just learn how to succeed in a system that favors one type of ‘smart' at the expense of all the others.  A system that frowns on taking chances or making mistakes when making mistakes and taking chances is what is needed for learning. For true learning. Her teacher tells her that she has passion and passion is everything.

    Feng dressed the part of slayer as she celebrated her Lazer Bears' victory over the reigning champion, Shock Demons.<br><br>Design inspired by <b>Agus Alvi</b>.
    Jeff Johansen was born and raised in Ormond, Alberta. He grew up as a quiet, only child with an aversion for large crowds. During high school, his anxious nature was mislabelled as shyness, which he covered up with a tough, stoic persona that intimidated bullies and teachers alike. At home, he discovered an interest for heavy metal and started a vinyl collection. The evocative symbolism on the covers inspired him to make some art of his own, which helped him cope with his parents’ constant fighting.<br><br>To escape his parents’ increasingly recurrent blow-ups, Jeff started working at a video store. Few customers passed by, so he had a lot of free time to draw. A late-night regular noticed his sketches and asked him to do some artwork for his gang at the abandoned lodge up Mount Ormond. Jeff accepted the challenge and painted a large mural depicting “The Legion” in runny, bloody letters. He was given a fifty-dollar bill and a 12-pack for his hard work. It was his first paid commission, a milestone to be proud of.<br><br>After his parents’ divorce, Jeff was forced to move with his mother to Winkler, Manitoba, which was miles away from his hometown—and his dad. In Winkler, Jeff was more isolated than ever, except for art and music. His solace came shortly after graduating high school when he started working at a local bar with live music performances. He found a roadie gig shortly after, leaving Winkler behind.<br><br>A few years later, Jeff got injured after getting involved in a fight during a concert. He was told he could lose part of his eyesight, so his doctor asked him to stay in town in order to monitor him. It was a difficult time during which Jeff re-assessed his life choices.<br><br>He went back to school—art school. His eyesight slowly returned, but he had to be careful. He took a few courses, experimenting with a wide range of mediums, ultimately choosing oil painting and digital art, the later of which offered paid internships. He took up a desk job and found his calling in designing labels for microbreweries. He led a quiet, simple life: he brewed beer, took-in a rescue dog, designed tattoos, and freelanced album covers for bands he liked. All until one morning, when he got a phone call from Ormond saying that his father had passed, leaving a few things to sort out.<br><br>Jeff drove all the way back to Ormond. He felt a pang of nostalgia when he reached his late father’s house. Inside, there was an old guitar case sitting in against the wall. It held a black, vintage model with a sticky note that said, “for my boy.”<br><br>He stayed in town longer than he planned to, reminiscing about his childhood. Driving by his former high school, he remembered the mural he painted up Mount Ormond. He bought a 12-pack and headed to the lodge.<br><br>After weeks of not hearing back from Jeff, his colleagues assumed that grief had gotten the better of him. His neighbor got tired of sitting his dog, which became more and more agitated as days went by. The dog became a stray again, erring while seeking the familiar trail of Jeff’s malty scent.

From the scale of the bloodletting, something horrid has taken place here.

    Insidious
    Danny Johnson, known as Jed Olsen by some, grabbed the newspaper from the kitchen counter: it was a week old, but his face was on the front page, grainy and sunken. It was one of those muggy afternoons in Florida when heat and humidity permeated everything in the kitchen, making him sweat while standing still. He slouched in a damp chair to read. This article had better be good—his work in Roseville had been outstanding.<br><br><i><b>GHOST FACE DISAPPEARS</b></i><br><br>June 18, 1993<br><br>At first glance, Jed Olsen was a modest and enthusiastic freelancer with experience in a variety of small newspapers. The staff at the Roseville Gazette appreciated how easy-going and honest he seemed, and so he was treated as a stranger for no more than five minutes into his interview:<br><br>“Jed quickly spotted the editor-in-chief in the room, gave him a wide smile and a firm handshake, and talked about good old American values. And that was it, he was in.”—Ex-Contributor at the Roseville Gazette<br><br>Olsen never justified his erratic career path, which zigzagged between several small towns from Utah to Pennsylvania. There was no verification of his previous jobs. He had a decent portfolio plus a good attitude, and they needed a contributor right away.<br><br><b>THE ROSEVILLE MURDERS</b><br><br>Olsen had been working at the newspaper for five months when the Roseville Murders began: victims from young to old, stabbed to death in their homes. From the reports, the victims seemed chosen at random, yet the killer knew his way around in the houses. The multiple stab wounds indicated a personal motive. No traces of DNA were found. The local police were confounded: the murders were carried with fury akin to a crime of passion yet coldly premeditated.<br><br>The murderer also liked to stalk his targets. Two victims had reported being followed on their way home by a dark figure, a few days prior their death. The killer would follow them from Walleyes, a small bar in Northern Roseville, and snap pictures of them at home, while looking for a way in. He could watch the same victim for weeks, meticulously registering their habits and routines. When he felt the urge to kill, he’d visit the most vulnerable victim on his list, and break inside the house quietly.<br><br>The whole staff worked on the Roseville Murders story. Olsen was often sent to interview the family of victims and relay official statements from the police. Unknown to everyone at the time, his involvement added to the final body count.<br><br><b>THE GHOST FACE</b><br><br>Panic swelled in Roseville when Olsen produced footage of a hooded figure breaking into a house at night. The masked face, a white blur in the dark, stared at the camera for a second, before disappearing inside. “Ghost Face Caught on Tape” was the resulting article, written by Olsen. He seemed proud of his work at the time, enjoying how the whole town feared his ghost stories.<br><br>Weeks later, Olsen left a note on his work desk and disappeared:<br><br>“I hope you liked my stories--I enjoyed bringing them to life. Don’t worry, I'm not done.” –Jed Olsen<br><br>The Roseville law enforcement still refuses to comment as Jed Olsen remains at large. <br><br>Danny smiled, ripping out the article from the newspaper. When the investigation had been pointing to him, he’d packed his bags and left Roseville swiftly.<br><br>He got up, the clammy seat pulling his skin. An oppressive humidity engulfed him as he entered the bedroom. Condensation dribbled on a small misted-up window as bits of cracked wallpaper hung limply. Its floral pattern was covered with gruesome photos and newspaper headlines. Danny pinned the week-old article on top of a picture of lacerated scalps. A faint pang of hunger hit him, and he wondered when he had eaten last. Was it this morning, while washing his knife and clothes? Or was it last night, after following that girl down the street? He couldn’t remember clearly.<br><br>Taking a step back, he admired his work on the wall. His mind drifted, remembering all the articles he’d written, the stories he’d planned, and the scenes he’d brought to life.<br><br>A shiver ran through him. A chilling breeze transformed the bedroom's humidity into an opaque, freezing Fog. A woman shrieked. Dead leaves crunched under his feet.<br><br>He smiled in anticipation.
    This is not the Badham Preschool where children laughed and learned, made lifelong friendships and had their paintings hung on the walls. This is a dark echo created from the nightmares of those who suffered there. The walls creak under the burden of history. Events that should be long forgotten are recorded forever in the plaster and stone, pervading the building with misery. Only one part of the building is accurately reflected in this darkness. The squalid room where Freddy Krueger lived and worked. The hidden basement area where he committed the heinous acts that appalled a town and condemned him to death. This is a place of the subconscious, of the nightmare brought into hideous reality.

    The atmosphere of the realms is dark and grim to say the least but also… everchanging. I've already remarked that the atmosphere is misty even foggy at times and that this fog feels alive. It seems to contain swirls and streams of memories or imprints of beings from multiple terra worlds. It is as if The Entity absorbs all the psychic energy and thoughts of beings it snatches as it journeys through the endless cosmos.<br><br>I've used the Auris to study the black fog and have come to three observations that will prove invaluable to finding a way home. First, the fog is rich in Auric particles leading me to believe this dimension is more conscious than it is material. Second, I should be able to manifest anything I am able to pull from rifts in the fog using techniques passed down from my family. Third… The Entity is far more ancient than we ever suspected back home and most of our theories and conjectures were wrong. The rich presence of Auric particles and cells suggest it is one of the Original Ones—an Ancient.

Killers traverse these obstacles slowly, so they can be used by Survivors to gain distance.<br><br><b>Break line of sight:</b> To survive a chase, a Survivor should try to break line of sight and head in a direction the Killer does not expect or cannot anticipate.<br><br><b>Pallets:</b> Pallets are objects the Survivors can throw down in order to put an obstacle between themselves and the Killer. Killers can be stunned by dropping a pallet on them directly. Pallets can only be dropped once, after which they can be vaulted by Survivors or destroyed by Killers.<br><br>Keeping these points in mind will help you make it out of the chase alive.

    Jane Romero was the daughter of famous actress, Loretta Lawrence, of whom she had no memory. Her parents had separated when she was still a baby, mainly since her mother was often away filming. Jane was raised by her father, a struggling visual artist. She grew up torn between resenting her mother’s absence from her life and admiring her presence on screen.<br><br>As a teenager, Jane secretly wished to emulate her mother’s talent. She would direct and perform in plays, audition for TV commercials and help her father at his studio. During her senior year, she entered a national oratory contest and won first prize. Her performance attracted the attention of a radio-station that contacted her for an interview. During the live show, her natural charm and repartee impressed the staff, who offered her a part-time job at the station.<br><br>After graduating college in Communication, she quit her job at the station to work for a trendy variety show. But her frank delivery and ad-libs were not appreciated by the show’s executives, who fired her after five months. Desperate for another opportunity, Jane pitched a show at the radio-station she used to work at, only to be turned down, her proposal being <i>too risky</i>.<br><br>Four months later, she received a phone call from a producer who had seen reruns of the show. He was looking for a co-host to spark up the failing show, <i>Quick Talk</i>.<br><br>Live television meant long hours, a low salary, and no stability, but it also offered a platform to broadcast her views. She disputed the crude inflammatory tone of <i>Quick Talk</i> and pushed for a relatable coverage of personal issues. Her honest delivery resonated with her audience and within weeks, the show’s viewership was steadily growing.<br><br>After two years, she launched a full-hour segment called <i>The Jane Romero Show</i>, which was broadcast nationally and covered tabooed topics, including her personal struggle with abandonment. Her show broke records and her initials J.R. became synonymous with products ranging from beauty creams to fashion accessories.<br><br>But Jane needed more; she wanted others to follow in her footsteps. She published a memoir that covered her childhood with an absent mother. Her book was an instant best seller but was reviewed harshly. Critics called it <i>a serving of sad anecdotes seasoned with bland, generic self-help tips</i>. Jane took this criticism to heart, since despite her success, a voice in the back of her mind was starting to doubt her achievements.<br>Her success also generated an increasingly demanding schedule and a growing pressure to entertain constantly. During a particularly tense week, she canned an episode and instead launched a two-hour-long special on divorce. Her stress peaked when she learned that her mother had agreed to star in her show.<br><br>Jane put on a brave face and began the show. Most of it went without a hitch, but when her mother walked on set, smiling warmly at the audience, Jane’s stomach lurched unpleasantly. She was consumed by a violent envy that had been festering. Yet she carried on with a strained smile, until Loretta interrupted her, saying that they were not actually related. The interview went haywire after that.<br><br>After the show, Jane was driving to her father’s house in New Jersey. She needed to talk things over with him; she had not been feeling like herself lately. She turned on a freeway along the coast to avoid major congestion and popped some pain killers to numb the throbbing pain in her temples, which had been nagging her all day. Then she started to relax and turned on the radio; classical music was playing. The drive was slow. Black ice covered the highway, which was packed with cars on their way back home. Night fell. A darkness began to blur the corners of her vision and turned the headlights into swirls of red. Jane blinked to sharpen their outlines, but each time she closed her eyes, her eyelids became heavier and slower, until they remained shut, for a moment too long.<br><br>The following morning, authorities were fishing out Jane’s car from the water. Despite leading a meticulous search for weeks, they were unable to retrieve her body.<br><br>The airing and production of <i>The Jane Romero Show</i> was suspended until after her funeral, which her father and mother attended.<br><br>As the public grieved for Jane, there was a surge of orders for J.R. products and all her episodes were re-released a month later, with an opening credit that wished her eternal peace.

    The ultimate goal of the Killer is to sacrifice Survivors to The Entity. Once a Survivor is hung on a sacrificial hook, the sacrifice sequence will begin. It has 3 phases.<br><br><b>Phase 1: Summoning Phase</b><br>In this phase, The Entity is being summoned to the hook and takes some time to manifest. Hooked Survivors can be rescued or attempt to free themselves from the hook. These attempts have a 4% chance of success, and failure accelerates the summoning process.<br><br><b>Phase 2: Struggle Phase</b><br>Once The Entity has manifested itself around the hook, Survivors can no longer attempt to free themselves. They can only fight to survive. They may still be rescued by other Survivors.<br><br><b>Phase 3: Sacrifice Phase</b><br>The Entity will eventually overpower a hooked Survivor and devour them. The hook itself is destroyed at the end of the sacrifice sequence.<br><br>A Survivor who is rescued or escapes from the hook will progress to the next phase the next time they are hooked. For example, a Survivor who was freed in the summoning phase will progress immediately to the struggle phase the next time they are hooked. A Survivor who was freed during the the struggle phase and hooked again will be immediately sacrificed.

    Evan's inspired in a way he's never been before. Furiously he sketches his father in a bear suit killing his uncle. He never met his uncle, but he's seen pictures. His uncle was a philanthropist. A bleeding heart. Disloyal. He would have run the business into the ground with proper wages and all that socialist crap. That's why he had to go. Evan doesn't have proof, but he knows. Deep down he knows his father murdered his uncle. Tied him up. Left him for a bear. There was no knife. No fight. No honor. Just a terrible death for a disloyal worm. Evan suspects all this and yet… he doesn't feel disgusted or ashamed. He feels something else. Something he's trying not to feel. Something… he won't admit to himself.

He chews on a fatty piece of rabbit and hopes his father doesn't say anything. He should have known better than to keep something from him. His father knows. He always knows. Last year Evan lost his cool on a man who said something about his mother. He almost beat the man to death with a two-by-four while his father watched and laughed. The authorities pulled Evan away. He smiled at Evan and knew what he wouldn't admit to himself. He enjoyed beating on that man. Not because of the insult. Not because he felt threatened. But because he felt… Powerful... His father smiled. Apple doesn't fall to far from the tree, eh?

    This is not the Badham Preschool where children laughed and learned, made lifelong friendships and had their paintings hung on the walls. This is a dark echo created from the nightmares of those who suffered there. The walls creak under the burden of history. Events that should be long forgotten are recorded forever in the plaster and stone, pervading the building with misery. Only one part of the building is accurately reflected in this darkness. The squalid room where Freddy Krueger lived and worked. The hidden basement area where he committed the heinous acts that appalled a town and condemned him to death. This is a place of the subconscious, of the nightmare brought into hideous reality.

    MOUNTAIN SAVAGE
    Survivors are very vulnerable and have few methods of fighting back against the Killer. To avoid being caught, they should start by learning how to hide. Basic strategies can include crouching behind obstacles, finding cover in tall grass, tucking into dark corners or getting into lockers. However, to avoid detection, Survivors must gain understanding of the Killer's heightened senses.<br><br><b>Scratch Marks:</b> Running is louder than walking, but the real downside to running is the trail it leaves behind. These scratch marks can only be seen by the Killer. They disappear after a few seconds, but the trail they leave can lead the Killer straight to a running Survivor.<br><br><b>Loud Noises:</b> Some actions, such as window vaults, can be performed quickly or slowly (depending on whether the run button is held). Rushing these actions creates a loud noise signal that the Killer may see and hear. Be aware that these actions will give away your position. <br><br><b>Bloodstains:</b> Injured Survivors leave a trail of blood that is visible to all players. Survivors bleed regardless of whether they are walking or running. Bloodstains disappear after a few seconds.<br><br><b>Crows:</b> Crows are servants of The Entity. Survivors who startle them or get too close will cause them to caw loudly and take flight, which can tip off an attentive Killer.<br><br><b>Failed Skill Checks:</b> A failed Skill Check will create a loud noise signal for the Killer. Be very careful after failing a Skill Check! <br><br><i>Consult <b>"The Killers"</b> section of this guide for more information on the Killer's abilities.</i>

    Bloody David
    Survivors have 3 health states: <b>healthy</b>, <b>injured</b> and <b>dying</b>.<br>As a Survivor, here's what each health state means to you:<br><br><b>Healthy:</b> Survivors start the trial in this state. Taking damage while healthy puts Survivors into the injured state.<br><br><b>Injured:</b> While injured, Survivors will bleed and grunt, making them easier to track. Though an injured Survivor limps, their movement speed is the same as when healthy. Taking damage while injured puts a Survivor into the dying state.<br><br><b>Dying:</b> While dying, a Survivor's movement is limited to a slow crawl. A crawling Survivor has two options: recover as much health as they can, or crawl to find help. Without the aid of specialized perks, a Survivor cannot recover fully; they will need another Survivor to finish healing them. A crawling Survivor can be picked up by the Killer and brought to a sacrificial hook.

    Whether Killers perform their heinous acts by the compulsions of their diseased minds, or if they are forced into them by external pressures, has long been a matter of debate. But for one Killer, nature and nurture are inextricably linked.<br><br>Leatherface kills not from a desire to exert his will over others, to satisfy carnal urges, or even to quiet the voices in his head. He kills because he is scared. Scared that others will hurt him; scared that his family will be displeased with him, scared that their shared willingness to eat human flesh will be discovered.<br><br>He does as he is told, his family loves him and that is all that matters. Outsiders are a threat, and threats need to be dealt with. <br><br>Like those kids that came into the house, uninvited. Walked in like they owned the place. Looked around the house, trying to find out his family’s secrets, no doubt. But Leatherface dealt with them, protected his family, just as he’d been taught.<br><br>He is not just protector, he has many roles, and each role has its own face. He serves dinner, cares for the family, dresses well when they eat. His Grandpa and Ma used to care for them all, but Grandpa is old now and she has been still for a while, so Leatherface and his brothers had to take over. Family is everything to him. Family is security and safety. <br><br>But, even though he did his best, one of the kids got away. He tried to stop her, chasing after her as fast as he could, but she had help: another outsider, driving a truck. The evil trucker killed his brother, ran him over like he was a possum. In a fury, Leatherface leapt at him, the saw ready to avenge his family, but the trucker was too quick. He knocked Leatherface aside and turned his own saw against him. <br><br>As he watched the outsiders driving away, the rage, grief and pain combined with the worry about what would happen to his family now. They would surely return with the police, and the police would take his brothers, his Grandpa. Without them, what would he do? Without their commands, he would wither and die.<br><br>As his world collapsed, Leatherface spun in circles, swinging the saw all around, trying to fight off the myriad external threats that surrounded him.<br><br>Then another feeling overtook him. It came from outside his vision, crawling over his skin with cold dread. He realised that no matter what outsiders could do to him, there was something worse, something bigger that lived in the shadows. He was filled with a terror unlike any he had ever felt before. But it was almost comforting, like the fear he’d felt with his family. The fear of disappointing them.<br><br>He was brought to a place that was familiar but unknowable, and he instinctively knew what he had to do. He couldn’t fail it, the way he had his family. Outsiders would come but he would use his skills to overcome any threats. There would be screaming, but he could make the world quiet again. Until the only sound remaining was the blessed howl of the saw.<br><br>Let the outsiders come.

    Philip Ojomo came to this country without anything other than hope for a new beginning. He was happy as he got offered a job at Autohaven Wreckers. A small scrap yard where bribed cops turned a blind eye on the somewhat shady business that took place. Ojomo didn’t care. He had seen criminal activity up close in his homeland, and as long as he didn’t get involved, he let things be. He just fixed cars and handled the crusher. Something he did really well. A car went in, a small, metallic cube came out.<br><br>It was not until one gloomy day that he, just by accident, saw some blood coming from one of the un-crushed cars. As he opened the trunk he found a young man, gagged with tied hands and panic filled eyes. Ojomo freed the man who managed to run ten feet before Ojomo’s boss stopped him and slit his throat. As Ojomo demanded answers he was explained that he’d been nothing more than a simple executioner as more or less every car had a soul in them. This was a "service" the scrap yard provided to certain "clients". Ojomo snapped and went ballistic. He threw his boss in the crusher and let it slowly compress, as the head stuck out, Ojomo grabbed it and pulled head and spine out of the body. Then he left, and was never seen again.<br><br>

    <i>NOTE: The Twitch Challenge feature is currently in Beta as we gather feedback from our community.</i>

<b>What are Twitch Challenges?</b>

Twitch Challenges are leaderboard competitions hosted by Twitch broadcasters for players to compete against each other based on Emblem scores at the end of a match. Certain Challenges may have associated prizes organized by the broadcaster.

<b>Who can create a Twitch Challenge?</b>

We are initially restricting the list of Challenge creators to our Fog Whisperers, with an eventual rollout to more broadcasters.

<b>Where can I see the leaderboard and my ranking?</b>

You can view the leaderboard and rankings on the broadcaster’s Twitch channel in the GameOn extension.

<b>What are Attempts?</b>

Attempts are the limited number of times you may contribute your Emblem score to a Challenge. Example: An Attempt limit of 3 means your next 3 matches will count towards the Challenge in which you’re currently participating.

<b>Why do I need a password for some Challenges?</b>

Some broadcasters may want to limit their created Challenge to a select group, such as their viewers or subscribers. In this case, this group will be able to retrieve the password on the broadcaster’s Twitch channel.

<b>What is the difference between "joining" and "participating"?</b>

Players may "join" a limit of 10 Challenges at any given time, but must select which Challenge they are "participating" towards for their next match. Any points earned at the end of a match and attempts used will be put towards this participating Challenge, with the ability to switch between joined Challenges between matches if the player wishes.
When a player submits their score for their last attempt, they will automatically start participating in the next available joined Challenge.

<b>Will I be matched with other members of a Twitch Challenge?</b>

Participation in a Twitch Challenge is passive, meaning matchmaking will continue as normal while your points are calculated on the side. You will continue to be matched with players who may or may not be participating in Twitch Challenges.
