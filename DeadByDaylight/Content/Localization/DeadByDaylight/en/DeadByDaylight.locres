    Lisa doesn’t know if it’s the symbols on her book or some kind of placebo effect… but her math scores are improving. Not as much as they should be, but still…she’s passing and passing is an improvement. Her friend Pam says it’s all malarkey. There’s no such thing as lucky symbols that can raise your grade. It’s all smoke and mirrors. Unfounded, ancient superstition. Jokingly Pam says she wants better marks, too. She grabs Lisa’s textbook and copies the symbol in her school agenda several times. Lisa feels a tug in her gut, and she stares at the symbols with concern. You really shouldn’t do that. She yanks her textbook back from Pam. You shouldn’t mess with powers you don’t understand. Pam laughs. What’s the problem, Lisa? If these things can help you pass math, they can help me pass English, too. No big deal.

    The night whispers in your ears as you feel claws grazing your skin. Bear the markings of evil.
    Jake charges after the boar as it zigzags through the long grass and suddenly disappears near the creek. Panting, he slows to a jog, searching left and right. He’s hiding. Hiding like the letter his father hid in the attic. Don’t lose your focus, Jake… not now… not again…  

I don’t understand why he would hide such a beautiful letter in a shoebox?  

Ah, yes...the letter. It’s the letter that set you off on your journey. It’s the letter that inspired you to learn your father’s language properly. You wanted to translate it for yourself, and you did. But now, Jake, you need to stop thinking about the letter, about your father, about the past… you need to focus on the hunt or none of it will matter anymore. Find food or become food.  

Jake winces. His grandfather would never say such a thing. That’s something his father would say. The voices in his head are mixing like a horrible stew of fermenting leftovers. He doesn’t remember when he started hearing the voices but at some point out on his own in the mountains, he realized he was talking to himself and that talking to himself helped him cope with the loneliness.  

Everyone hears voices inside their head, Jake, although most are too distracted to listen or even acknowledge them, or, if they do acknowledge them, they keep them private for fear of ridicule.  

Most of Jake’s voices are family members and old friends that make friendly talk here and there, but as of late the voices poke and question everything he does.  

And now for the last two days he was hearing a new voice. A mocking voice that highlighted and criticized every mistake he made like his dreaded high school English teacher that made him read garbage he didn’t connect with or gave him nicknames like ‘muddle brain’ for mixings up words, reading backwards and seeing things in the stories she claimed weren’t there. They were. She just lacked imagination and perspective.  

It was her voice—teeth grinding on wool—that squelched through his mind to undermine his dignity and confidence as a thinking human being.   

Jake was convinced his teacher had existed solely to prevent those with other ideas and perspectives from ever pursing a literary career. His father didn’t care about his issue with his English teacher or with teachers in general.  

It didn’t matter.  

Stories didn’t matter.  

Just tell the teacher what she wants to hear. Think of her as your boss and think of grades as money. Parrot her ideas and opinions and you’ll be rewarded with lots of money… maybe even a bonus or a promotion.   

Easy enough advice to follow.  

And yet his father’s advice did nothing to improve his sense of otherness in relation to the stories and curriculum he was subjected to on an almost daily basis. He still felt like an outsider for lacking interest in the literature and history he was expected to read and memorize as truths undeniable. Seemed like there was a big chunk of perspective missing from the overall narrative being poured into him like concrete that made him feel like he didn’t belong.  

But what does it matter now?  

It doesn’t.  

Leave the past in the past and focus on what needs to get done.  

I’m trying.  

Listen here, big brother... the sun’s coming down, you’re having conversations with yourself, and your cells are about to cannibalize one another. Find your focus.

    Dwight stares in disbelief as Lazar asks Rose to present the advantages of Story-Hook advertising at an all-hands meeting. He interrupts her on every slide in front of everyone then cancels the meeting. He acts as though it's the first time he's seen Rose's deck. He announces Rose has no idea what a Story-Hook is. Everyone leaves the cafeteria feeling bad for her, grumbling that no one knows what he means by Story-Hook or how stupid he is for using a contrived term that just means story. Dwight doesn't understand because she validated every slide in her deck with Lazar. He heard them agree. Before Dwight can talk to her she is fired and escorted out of Peak 22. Dwight watches his friend, a single mother, walk out. This year's patsy for Lazar's excesses. He siphons the investment money and his friend gets the boot. The whole meeting was a set-up to discredit her in front of everyone. Lazar approaches Dwight. Sorry, Dwitch, I know Rose was your manager but I had to let her go. She wasn't aligned with our company values. Dwight stares at Lazar in mingled shock and horror. What values? He wants to scream at Lazar. He wants to grab his ears and rip them out of his narcissistic head. Instead he nods and silently prays there is justice in the world.

    I have been obsessively deciphering Vigo’s journal. His work is elegant but erratic, drawing obscure conclusions from disjointed fields.<br><br>Most entries mention a powerful force, The Entity, which undergoes a purge that occurs once a year. During this period, The Entity is infested with blight. According to Vigo, cankers bloom into “Pustulas,” a type of flower that spurts putrid nectar—the thick fluid I saw oozing from the trees. The last pages of the journal mention a serum distilled from the nectar, but the pages detailing its effects and preparation were torn out.

    Once opulent and well-tended by priests, the shrine was abandoned for reasons unknown. Season after season, the harsh and unforgiving weather corroded its grandeur. Paths that welcomed weary travelers, were now thick with vegetation growing damp and unrestrained. The sculptures were a haven for moss and lichen, concealing a scratched and brittle stone.<br><br>Kazan shuddered with rage as he stepped into the area. Unable to restrain himself, he unleashed his might on a statue atop the shrine, clubbing its arms and head to pieces. Even after he left, a rot seemed to pervade the air. The chimes of bells played softly on the wind, as everything around them crumbled. Torn from Kazan's memories, the shrine now stood on the estate of his childhood home—a trick by The Entity that infuriated him even more.

    I have culled imprints of a killer I have yet to observe. My best guess, judging by the nature of the crimes, is this brute is from Terra Dark. She lured men with love, robbed them of their savings and fed them to her pigs. Lovely. Efficient. And resourceful. The impressions of the memory are as follows…<br><br>…He stands framed in the doorway with flowers. A stupid smile on his dumb face. He has no sense that his days are numbered. Lonely soul made the trip for a wife. He thinks he'll get everything for a ring. Her land. Her farm. Her savings. Won't happen. Won't go as planned. Not as he planned, anyway. It didn't for all the other lonely souls who answered her classified ad. She peers at his eyes and thrills at his ignorance. His long, dumb face. His false sense of superiority. He wrote her a poem. How sweet. She'll cram it down his throat when he's convulsing on the floor. She takes his poem and asks about his money. He has it with him. Packed his savings in a bag and made the journey for a new start. He'll get more than he bargained for. Way more. To the bank with his money. To the pigs with him.

    Charlotte’s family had suffered enough. She was determined to persecute humanity tenfold for their atrocities.
    Extinction of Hope
    Chamber of Blood. Harbinger of Hell. Evil Eyes. 2.<br><br>“The thugs were ambushed in the valley near the ruins of the old signaling fort,” a turbaned man with a beard said. “I'm not sure what you hope to find here. Most stay away from this place like the plague.” He stared at the older teens as if they were mad. “You should have returned to the hotel like your uncle. Nothing here but the eyes, and they're probably watching us right now.”  

Haddie and Jordan didn't answer or want to explain that their uncle didn't have the stomach for adventure, that he was more of a producer and that he was trying to finish off a horror novel he'd been working on for the last ten years. Ignoring the guide's nervous ramblings, Haddie studied the white stone bricks of the ruined fort and the surrounding caves with a strange feeling that they were being watched.  

The guide said, “The official story is a unit of British soldiers died fighting a band of thugees.”   

“And the unofficial story?” Haddie turned to him. The guide stared at her for a long moment. “The unofficial story is they turned their rifles and swords against each other. Something in these caves drove them mad.”  

Haddie absorbed this and closed her eyes while Jordan filmed the ruins and the caves. Calming her heart and silencing her mind, she began to hear the rising screams and cries of people being butchered. When she opened her eyes again, she could see the scintillating orange residual memories of British soldiers cutting down thuggee rebels.  

One thug seemed to be holding something important in his hands as he escaped the massacre. She walked through residual memories and approached the thug, starring at a piece of broken pillar in his hand. The thug desperately clambered over the rocks and rubble, charging into a nearby cave with the soldiers in hot pursuit.  

Jordan stepped up behind her. “Did you see anything?” 

Haddie nodded and pointed at the cave the thug had run into.  

The guide raised his eyebrows. “And that's my cue to go,” he said, turning his back on the siblings. “Not that I think you're both crazy… which I do… but I need to get home before my wife realizes I'm gone. It's my day to make rotis and pick up the kids from school.”  

Haddie and Jordan watched the guide disappear down the rocky, sun-baked valley. Then they turned and approached the gaping mouth of the cave. For a long moment they stared into the darkness without saying a word. Jordan turned on the flashlight of his cellphone and just as they prepared to enter, they heard the crunch of stone behind them. Brother and sister turned slowly to face the barrel of a rifle.

    Most Killers are quite large and easy to spot. However, Survivors do have a few extra situational awareness advantages they can use to increase their odds of survival.<br><br><b>Third Person View:</b> Survivors have a versatile third person view which grants them 360 degree situational awareness. It can also be used to look around corners or over obstacles and locate the Killer without being seen.<br><br><b>Terror Radius:</b> The Killer's approach is signalled by a heartbeat. As the Killer gets closer, the heartbeat intensifies. Experienced Survivors can use the Terror Radius to accurately determine the distance between themselves and the Killer.<br><br><b>The Stain:</b> The Stain is an eerie red light emitted in front of the Killer. It is especially good for quickly determining where the Killer is looking. If you are in a chase and see the stain bathing your character in its red glow, don't panic. It's too late.

It's the name he gave to those people who need to be right… who always need to be right. They were the easiest to push over the edge. Ormond was full of them. Ugly people. Entitled preps and politicians who would turn blue in the face if you challenged any of their beliefs. Julie hands Frank a ski mask. He gives her a curious look. Tonight we all play a game.

    Designed by Umbrella Corporation, The Nemesis is a nearly unstoppable super soldier fixated on pursuing and eliminating its targets. Part of the Tyrant T-103 series, this specimen has increased intelligence and awareness due to the NE-α parasite implanted within it. Its first mission unleashed it upon Raccoon City, where it had a singular objective: exterminate S.T.A.R.S. members. Rampaging through the city, The Nemesis faced off against Jill Valentine multiple times, and though she managed to escape, he was never far behind. He nearly had his target, when a strange fog descended upon them, mixing with the smoke of a city in chaos. The phenomenon meant nothing to him—the frigid cold and decreased oxygen never posing a threat. All that mattered was soldiering on into the fog, continuing the mission: find S.T.A.R.S., exterminate S.T.A.R.S., and kill anyone who gets in the way.

    Instead of reading aloud in my usual way, I clambered to the roof of my tower and conjured a fire and a radio to listen to some ghost stories from a half-remembered radio serial from Terra Dark. Without a doubt listening to these stories has proven to be the best way to pass the time especially when you’ve got endless voices clattering in your head, bringing you down with their endless agonies and anxieties. Later I used the Auris to manifest The Storyteller to read his stories like he had done for his weekly podcast. He was composed of ever-moving, black fog, and I suspect that one day I’ll actually be able to recreate a more realistic person to listen to or perhaps even engage with in something that resembles a conversation.  Listening to The Storyteller and hearing familiar expressions I am wondering: how do I keep myself out of my own creations? The memories I attempt to record as fast as I experience them prove one thing to me. They show me objectivity is impossible, or elusive at best, and I’m never quite sure if my logs are a true and accurate depiction of the subject’s memory or a whiskey laden interpretation of a nightmare. To add to my frustrations, I have recently noticed other voices have made their way into my notes. Other interpretations. Other thought-patterns from people whose memories I’ve likely spent too much time reliving. They are becoming a part of me and that wasn’t supposed to happen.
    Cage of Atonement
    Claudette will be eight-years-old tomorrow. She should be eager. She should be excited. She should be counting the hours, minutes, seconds... Instead, she is none of these. She dreads the moment she will have to open her gift. Every year it's the same. Dolls. Crafts. Jewelry. Nothing that means anything to her. Maybe this year she'll smile and pretend she didn't want a magnifying glass or a collection of stones or a set of books on botany. Maybe… to make things easier… she'll pretend. Maybe that will make her mother less scared for her. Seeing her happy about her grades felt good. Real good.
    	
    Close call today. Came in contact with the arachnas while testing multiple versions of the toxin. The doctor saw them coming through the window and ordered me to leave everything behind. She said we would return to the lab when the arachnas were gone and it was safe again. We still haven’t found a toxin deadly enough to eliminate these horrible creatures, but I feel we’re close. Very close. If we had a sense of their origins, it would help. As it stands, we still don’t know where they came from or what they want. All we know is the attacks started at the same time.  What makes our investigation more challenging is the fact that their DNA is unlike anything we’ve ever encountered. It’s as though… it’s as though they came from another place…

    You've been caught in The Trapper's Bear Trap! Each Killer has a unique power that you must learn to avoid.
    Even with no eyes he can see. It doesn't make any sense. He clambers about the muck and grime. He slips and falls and suddenly realizes he's clambering over a heap of rotting prisoners and addicts. He pushes through as the groveling men and women beg for more opioids… for tea… for syrup… for opium laced candies… they make ridiculous promises… take my house… my money… my children… take everything… give me more… just a little more… They sound like him. He pushes through a blur of faces he vaguely recollects. Lives ruined, shattered, destroyed. Wasn't his fault. He hears a disembodied voice. Kill them all and a flower you will have. He stares down at the agonizing men and women and withdraws his cane. Smashes through limbs and skulls furiously. Heads burst open like watermelons. Bones break like dry sticks. He doesn't stop until he stands atop a mountain flesh, vomit and gore. Where is it? Where's my flower? Find it. He falls to his knees and digs through the thick sludge of mangled humanity to search for a flower… finds one… but just as he touches the flower it withers away and disappears along with the remnants of his past.

Why was he experimenting on them? He doesn't… remember. He caused a lot of suffering, but he doesn't feel remorse. He doesn't even know if he should feel remorse. He doesn't feel anything but an ache in the pit of his stomach for power.

    The days pass, but Sally's unsure how many. She always finds herself back in the asylum, tending to the frantic, the violent, the feeble. Down the hall, the Bad Man has slipped his restraints again. Like a wolf, he shows no motive but to prowl for the weak, and it appears he's found his prey. He drags the naked body of the Rancid Son by the ankles. Blood spills from the Son's head. Sally does not know if the man is dead. Calling for help, she sprints down the hall with a syringe filled of sedatives. There are no other nurses to come to her aid. Financial restrictions have seen to that. She considers that she is running to her death this time, but there is something involuntary in her movements, as if she has become a spectator. The Bad Man lets go of the Rancid Son's ankles and turns his attention to Sally. He fails to notice Harvey Kavanagh, the plump orderly, round the corner behind him. Harvey slams The Bad Man into the floor as he's done to so many patients. Sally jabs a sedative into the Bad Man's neck. The Bad Man sags in place and with a look of bewilderment falls to the ground.<br><br>The decrepit hall is silent. Sally looks over the scene at her feet. Kavanagh's sizable frame hefts up and down as he catches his breath, thick arm slung over The Bad Man who rests peacefully. The Rancid Son, either unconscious or dead, lies beneath them with Kavanagh's boot pressed against his nostril. The smear of blood from his head goes on for thirty feet down the hall before curling into an adjacent room. Sally laughs to stop herself from screaming.

    Nea skates to the side wall of the bottling factory. They make glass and plastic bottles for fresh water and dump their chemicals and poisons in the river. How fuckin stupid is this place. How stupid is the city and that bastard of a mayor to allow such a thing. She searches for the perfect spot, the perfect surface to tag. She sees a spot high up in the open. That should annoy them. She sneaks to the front door, sees a camera, spray paints the lens of camera, begins to tag the wall. They poison water to provide bottles for good water. Absurd. Ridiculous. Unbelievable. Nea finishes her good work with time and paint to spare. She searches the premises and finds a large white garage door. Smiles. Perfect. She'll tag her name nice and big for everyone to see. That oughta piss off a tyrant as Casey says. The cause is actually getting to Nea and she wishes her art would piss the factory and the city enough for them to clean up the river. Wishful thinking. They came. They profited. They left… left an entire community poisoned. Gotta be laws against that and maybe even a death sentence for those who knowingly poison children.

    Safehouses are abandoned but they're still treasure troves of supplies. This beast of a flu hit fast and took no prisoners. Bill sighs and doubts evacuations are still running counter to Zoey's belief that the government actually still gives a shit. World has gone to hell and the government don't care but he ain't saying anything. Last thing he'll do is rob them of hope as they creep through the bowels of the fallen city. He liked Zoey's other idea about finding an island to rot on. That was a good idea. If you're gonna rot anywhere, an island, any island, ain't half a bad idea. Especially one with coconuts. But if she wants to hope for the government she can go right ahead. He ain't gonna take away her hope. Even if he knows enough about the government to know they ain't worth a second thought let alone a second chance. But he'll shut up for a civilian that still believes in the system… a system that was broken long before the flu spread. Besides, while she hopes for the government he'll figure something out. He always does. Zoey regards him. There's gotta be more like us... areas that have be protected…  quarantined. It can't be that all cities are like this. Bill supresses a cynical remark. There's something in Zoey he respects.  She reminds him of someone he used to know. Someone he used to be. Someone who had all kinds of ideas and ideals before he had seen the true face of governments… of humanity…  it's nice to see that in her. Real nice. He hopes it lasts and this hell doesn't stamp it out of her. A heavy wind moans dreadfully and carries with it an all too familiar smell... the smell of rot... the smell of filth... the smell of death. The infected. Dozens of them. Maybe hundreds. Bill acts on instinct. Eyes open! Guns ready! Before he can say another word the infected close in on them. Gunshots clap through the dead city. Heads crack open like rotten, festering melons and the infected lay strewn all around them. One lashes out of the shadows toward Bill. Without hesitation Francis blows its face off and turns to him. Merry Christmas! Bill sighs deeply. Bastard saved my life and now he's trying to rub it in my face. He gives Francis a stern, grizzled look. Alright… the line's yours, now shut the hell up and shoot! Bill curses under his breath and continues to shoot dark silhouettes charging through the deep, orange dusk. Damn, I missed this.

    Shame washes over Adiris as she retreats to her room. She dared doubt the gods. Within their chaotic whispers: pain, anger, bloodlust. ATONE! She removes her robe, reaches for the lash, a crude whip of thorns and bronze spikes. ATONE! She swings with great force. Spikes pierce her back, hooking into flesh as she pulls away. Through gritted teeth, she screams, keeping the sound in the base of her throat so no one can hear. ATONE! She swings, droplets of blood sprinkling to the floor. Spasms of pain, as skin tears off, hanging on pale threads. Braces herself and whips again, again, till the crimson pools. ATONE! How much blood is enough? Her body screams in agony. She thinks to drop the lash, run from these walls, but remembers the doctrine Haban taught her: Suffering is the heart of love. She tightens her grip and swings again.

    Hitting zero. That's why she returns to the forest time and time again. To let go of her anxieties. To let go of her problems. To take in the scent of fresh pine and let go of her conscious self. To let go of everything and listen to her muse. She's been out of touch with herself for a while, lost in a game to please everyone else except herself, playing songs that don't come from her but are sure to please the masses. Music that doesn't even resonate with her. Playing songs for money despite the warning: play one song for money and kill your muse. She laughed when her mother first told her this. It's seemed like a ridiculous thing to say. Her muse didn't seem to be going anywhere. She was hearing more songs in her head than she could play in a lifetime. Now… now…she's not laughing anymore. She's never felt so false and uninspired in her life, and more than ever she wants to reconnect with her music… her muse… herself. She closes her eyes and peels away the layers until her mind is empty and open to the great unknown.

He learned a lot of things on TV but never that. The thought of a cricket farting makes Boy smile. He likes smiling. He crawls closer to the police crew. Two new men on the hunt with Chief but he doesn't see any dogs. He figures he best take them down before the dogs arrive. He's seen police dogs on TV. They can sniff out anything. These deputies seem angrier than the last. He's not sure if it's because he felled their friends or if he ended their cleaning racket with his Pa. Maybe both. He just gets the sense if they catch him they'll make him suffer and squeal like a pig. Those pigs. Those damn pigs they loved so much. Why did they have to love them so much and him so little. Had they treated him like those pigs he would have been happy. He would have been happy and he would have been something else. He would have been a hero like that boy who wore a cape and helped the world all because of how his Ma and Pa raised him.

I can barely recognize my own thoughts or distinguish my memories from those I've been studying.  Last night I relived the most horrific murders in my collection with a strange kind of… pleasure... When I had had enough, I looked in the mirror and did not see myself but dozens of faces morphing in and out of each other. Every possible face except my own. I thrust my fist into the mirror and my hand split and blood was everywhere. What cruel fate has befallen me that I should lose myself in the darkness while trying to escape its deadly grasp.

    LEGACY
    False Silver Lining Performance
    I have seen them, the spiders, in my mind. They’re coming! They’re coming for us all! Big ones! Small ones! Even giant ones the size of dinosaurs. I see them in my visions charging through the streets bringing truth and understanding to the ignorant.  

But now… now… they’re safe… they’re hiding… hiding in my head and I can feel them crawling through my ear and skull, laying their eggs, nibbling at my nerves and waiting… waiting for the right time to burst out into the world to help humanity achieve transcendence. I actually don’t even know what that means… but they whisper it to me every night before I sleep.  

I remember the cave… I remember how it all happened… how I breathed them in… they were in the thick, dark mist. Little things that are now growing inside me, consuming me, showing me visions of Truth, and whispering sweet nothings to me… a million chattering voices telling me I am the one… the chosen one… the one who will change the entire world as we know it. And yet…  

The unbelievers try to medicate me! They try to poison the life growing inside me… They want to kill my children and prevent me from doing with my life what I was always meant to do. I have heard them go so far as to call me insane. Insane? How? How am I insane? Would an insane person protect the life growing inside them? Would an insane person set aside his wants and needs for the life growing inside him?  

Of course not! They are the ones who are insane. They are the ones who need to be medicated. I am the only sane one in this absurd institution. I’ve done everything for the spiders crawling under my skin and the doctor sprawled at my feet will never harm them again. They are ready, and they are pushing out of my skull and crawling down my nose and out my mouth and I am becoming something more.  

How could they doubt! How could they not see? How could they not see what I am and what I have become? They will burst out of me and consume me and I will be the apocalypse.

Forces him to gasp for air, heavy and sticky in his lungs. Everything's ruined. He claws his nails into the car seat, forces his mouth shut to keep himself from screaming.

Quickly... he needs music, fumbles for his earbuds, drops them to the floor, frantically scours. The only song playing is his teeth audibly grinding.

The show's about to begin.<br><br><b>***</b><br><br>Ji-Woon grabs Lucas' neck in a chokehold, shoves the chloroform-soaked cloth into his face. The two struggle in a frenzied dance.

Rain smashes down, muting the battle under the pattering of a hundred drops, concealing the outside behind a windshield of streaming water. Lucas grabs a handful of hair and pulls Ji-Woon forward, breaking the chokehold. He bites deep into Ji-Woon's wrist, drawing blood. Ji-Woon screams through gritted teeth, pushing the cloth harder into Lucas' face until he's beating him with it. Lucas flails his other arm in a desperate bid, searching for a solution with no plan. His hand relaxes, releasing Ji-Woon's hair.

She hears her mom’s voice rattle in her brain. The only luck you get is the luck you make. And yet… the piece of tire kind of looks like a horseshoe. Coincidence? Probably. She admires her lucky slice of tire and starts when she hears a twig snap behind her. Before she realizes what’s happening, she’s thrust to the ground by a shadowy figure who stomps on her ankle. Terrible pain shoots up her spine and she screams for help as the shadow bolts away. Meg screams in agony as she desperately scrambles to her feet. As soon as her wounded foot touches the ground another sharp pain rushes through her like wildfire and she collapses. She closes her eyes, gathers herself, suppresses her pain and reaches around for something, anything, to support her weight. A moment later she grabs a thick, gnarled, branch and shrieks as she forces herself to stand. Every step home is like a hammer smashing at her ankle.

These discoveries led to entire paradigm shifts that unlocked for us our ability to travel from dimension to dimension.

    Constable Duncan J. Smith said thousands of dogs haunted him wherever he went, but no one else saw them.  To get away from the dogs he would hide in the crawl space underneath his cabin, or he would hide in the shed where he kept his snowmobile, or sometimes he would escape to the glaciers and hide in the ice caves where he prayed for the howling and the yelping and the whimpering to stop. But the howling and the yelping and the whimpering never stopped, and no matter where he hid, the dogs always found him.  

The first day Duncan saw the dogs was the day he started questioning his job. Or rather, it was the day he started questioning the law and what he was doing with the law. There was something about legally destroying dogs that felt off… that felt… wrong… something that tugged at his heart and wouldn’t let go… something telling him that he needed to get out of the cold, lonely Arctic Archipelago before it was too late—if it wasn’t already too late.  

For Duncan, it was the first time in his career as a police officer that he realized that the law wasn’t always the glorified tool for civilization he had imagined it to be. Sometimes the law was something else.  Something blunt. Something hard.  Something almost like a gavel… a gavel of destruction or oppression or perhaps both—destruction and oppression.  

Truth is, Duncan wasn’t sure what he was thinking anymore. He was exhausted, and the dogs… well… the dogs just wouldn’t leave him be, and all he wanted to do was return home and farm. He liked working on the farm. Things were simpler on the farm.  But here, up north, things were more complicated, and Duncan couldn’t help but think about the law.  

About the gavel.  

And the last thing Duncan wanted to do was wield that gavel against anyone. And yet—to his everlasting regret—he had used it against the dogs.  

And though he had done everything by the book… and though the law said he had committed no crime… his heart continually testified to the opposite.   

To be sure, Duncan had led countless dogs to the bay, where he had shot them like vermin in front of their owners. And it was only when he was alone and surrounded by their ghosts that he would admit to himself that what he had done didn’t feel so right and that maybe... just maybe... these dogs weren’t the dangerous beasts or the diseased rats his captain had made them out to be. They were… well… they were something else.   

They were friends.  

They were family members.  

They played with children, entertained them and kept them safe.  They warned against approaching wolves and polar bears, and even snowstorms. And more than anything they made sure no hunter ever got lost in a blizzard unlike those unreliable ‘iron dogs’ or snowmobiles that broke down in the middle of nowhere and left a trail of black smoke across the cold, white, endless expanse.  No ‘iron dog’ ever led someone out of a blizzard. The same... well... the same could not be said of the dogs…  

…the dogs he had so heartlessly destroyed.  

But in those days—when the production of the first commercial ‘iron dog’ commenced—there weren’t many challenges to the law, and so Duncan certainly tried to convince himself that he was doing the good and lawful thing for everyone.  

And while it’s true that the mind might not make the difference between what is right and what is lawful, the heart certainly does.   

The heart—it is often said—doesn’t lie.  

Nonetheless, Duncan found ways to trick himself and ignore the appeals of his heart. He told himself these dogs weren’t like other dogs, and he actually believed his lie for a few months. But as time wore on, he very quickly realized that these dogs were… well… like the dogs he had known back home.  

Knowing this made it harder and harder for him to fall asleep, and soon he started to hallucinate and see all the dogs he had shot.  

At first it was just one. Then it was two. Then a dozen. Then a dozen became a hundred. And a hundred became a thousand.  A thousand dead dogs howled and stared at Duncan every night, preventing him from sleeping, from dreaming, from thinking—preventing him from living the life he had once known.    

Everywhere Duncan went, there they were, the dogs, looking at him with those eyes—those pleading, confused eyes, wondering what they had done wrong, or how they had failed their family and friends to deserve such a cold and indifferent end.  

Truth is, Duncan couldn’t escape those ghosts any more than a dog could escape its own tail. Wherever he went, there they were, following him, reminding him of all the lives he had disrupted and destroyed with… well… with that gavel.  

One evening, Duncan sat in bed, holding his aching head in his hands, staring at the decaying dogs sitting all around him.  They watched him closely as he tried to fall asleep and howled or barked every time his eyelids began to slip. Trembling with fear and exhaustion, Duncan murmured he had done nothing wrong and that he had acted in accordance with the law and that they should just leave him alone.  But— 

The dogs wouldn’t leave him alone. They just stared at him in silence with those eyes—eyes that reminded him of his own dog.   

Anguished, Duncan lurched from his bed, screaming at the dogs, telling them he needed to sleep and that he wasn’t going to feel guilty for doing his damn job! He outright refused to apologize or feel guilty for doing what the law required him to do. What the law said he had to do!  

The dogs suddenly stirred anxiously about the cabin with their heads down and tails between their legs. Duncan’s screams grew louder and louder, and one by one, the dogs whimpered and whined for their lives like they had done when they had been destroyed. Then—just like that—they vanished into thin air as though Duncan had finally scared them away.   

When Duncan realized the dogs were gone, he collapsed into his bed and prayed that they should finally leave him alone.  He just wanted his life back, for the dogs had robbed him of his strength and freedom and even his sense of identity as a morally upright officer of the law.   

That night, a storm picked up and blew all around his small cabin. Feeling a chill seep through his bones, Duncan rose from the bed, and he made a small fire in the iron stove as he remembered his first and only dog, Buster, a plump Yellow Labrador Retriever with a black snout.  

Smartest, kindest and warmest dog he had ever known.   

To Duncan, Buster was more than just a dog. He was his guardian, his confidant, his best friend. He was the brother he never had. He caught rodents, guarded against coyotes and drove cattle on the farm. His father used to say a good dog was worth two or three farm-hands, and Buster was certainly worth four. Thinking about it now, he was glad that no one ever used the law against Buster, or any other dog in his town for that matter.  

To be sure, Buster wasn’t as big or strong as these Arctic dogs, but he was quite the hunter and had once even saved him from a wolverine. But what Duncan remembered most was that Buster used to curl up in bed with him to calm his anxious heart and help him drift away to sleep.   

And now Duncan longed for nothing more than the undisturbed, soundless sleep of youth.  And as he longed for sleep, the wind blew harder and fiercer through the cracks of his cabin. The fire flared, flickered and snapped, casting violent shadows that seemed to tell stories.   

Duncan rubbed his eyes to make the hallucinations go away. But wherever he looked the shadows took the form of officers and hunters shooting at confused and frightened dogs as a thick and unnatural black smoke began to fill the cabin.  

Duncan tried to pinch himself awake. But when he realized he wasn’t asleep, he quickly shut his eyes and once again begged for the dogs to just leave him alone.  

He wanted one night of rest. Just one night! His brain reeled with despair, and he began to hear the warped voice of his captain laughing at him, shouting at him, tormenting him, telling him the dogs were dangerous… aggressive… a definite blight on their future plans.  

Duncan felt madness clutching at the seams of his soul. He screamed that these were lies! All of them!  And when he opened his eyes again, the black smoke was gone, and the shadows were once again meaningless shapes flickering about the cabin.   

But just as Duncan sighed his relief, he heard a sound.  

A gentle, scratching sound.  At the door. Then he heard a bark that sounded vaguely familiar. The bark came again and again and it sounded like— 

Buster.  

Duncan narrowed his gaze and cautiously approached the thick, wooden door. The scratching stopped just as he placed his hand on the doorknob. He stood in silence for a long, tense moment. When the scratching came again, he quickly opened the door and caught a fleeting glimpse of yellow fur disappearing beyond thick sheets of falling snow.   

Exhausted and confused, Duncan rushed into the churning storm in his undergarments and slippers, yelling for Buster to wait for him. Then he stopped suddenly when he realized he was being irrational. His tired mind was playing tricks on him.  

Buster had been dead for over twenty years. He had been hit by a car. And for a fleeting moment, Duncan remembered holding his paw on the side of the road, calming him down as his life slowly seeped away. He had never cried so much in his life. There was no possible way Buster could still be with him.  

Covered in snow, Duncan told himself the solitude was getting to him and that he just needed one night of undisturbed sleep.  He turned back toward the cabin. But as he turned, he realized…  

…he was lost.  

He couldn’t see an inch in front of him in any direction.  Cold and panic swept over him at once.  He turned and turned as the wind howled and shrieked and whimpered. In the raging blizzard, he could only make out— 

Dogs.  

Ghostly dogs.  Dead and decaying dogs. Thousands of them. Running around him. Growling. Howling. Barking. Confusing him.  

Duncan shouted for them to stop, and he tried to scare them off as he had done before. But the dogs grew faster and fiercer as though they were one with the storm.  

Duncan fell to his knees and felt the cold bite all over his trembling body. His face twisted in terror as each dog seemed to pounce out of the storm to take its turn chomping down on him with cold, indifferent teeth. He collapsed to his side in agony. A terrible numbness crept over him, not so much from the cold but the memory of hurting all those poor dogs. He begged for them to stop, and then he did what he had never done before.  

He confessed his shame and begged for forgiveness.   

At once, the dogs froze and stared at him with eyes that seemed to look straight into his heart.    

Duncan choked out that he was sorry, that he was truly sorry, and that even though he had done everything by the book, he had done everything wrong. He had done them wrong. He had done their families wrong. And he had done himself wrong.  

And as he emptied his heart, he heard a familiar bark as Buster suddenly emerged from the ghostly pack and stood before him.   

The dogs looked at Buster, then Duncan, then Buster again. A wave of peace seemed to wash over them as they disappeared one by one and left Duncan with his guardian… his friend… his brother. And Buster curled down beside Duncan as his heart slowed to a stop, and the blinding, white storm swept his life away as it had done so many others.  

 

When Constable Duncan J. Smith didn’t show up at the station the next day, his fellow officers searched for him and found his frozen corpse not ten feet from his cabin. He was lying on his side with a peaceful expression on his face. One officer noticed that he had been running around in circles, while the others questioned why he had been foolish enough to leave his cabin in his undergarments in the middle of a snowstorm.  

The captain kneeled by Duncan’s frozen black and blue face and sighed.  Just as he ordered someone to cover the body, another officer panicked and rubbed his eyes, claiming he saw dogs all around him.  He stumbled back and screamed for the dogs to stay away from him. No one saw what he was seeing, and the captain told him to stop making jokes at Duncan’s expense. But the frantic officer shrieked in terror and swore that the dogs were real and that they were following him.  
    Near Miss
    The Storyteller kept me entertained throughout the night with his gory tales of Nosferatu so that I almost forgot my own personal living, nightmare. His stories entertain and make for a perfect distraction when smashing golf balls into the abyss just won’t suffice. There have been countless tales of vampires, and to be certain I’ve read most of them, but to my mind… his are the most chilling. More than once now I’ve woken in a cold sweat with the sense that my tower has been overrun by these horrible creatures with fangs for teeth.

    Darkness. Jeffrey hears Moustache bumping around up ahead but can’t see a thing. He fumbles with wires, jams them at a wall, searching for an outlet. Bingo. Colorful lights flood over him. Playful music fills the area. An animatronic dog stares at Jeffrey with dead plastic eyes. Let's be friends. Jeffrey delivers a solid kick to the dog’s chest. Let’s be fr-fr-fr-frieeeeee—. Moving on. As soon as Jeffrey reaches the hall, he’s overtaken by a teddy bear parade. Cartoonish animatronics emerge from the walls, singing, smashing cymbals, playing flutes. Or at least pretending to. Crackling music plays from speakers above, singing a stupid song about hugs bringing the world together. Jeffrey elbows his way past Billy Bear and Dingles. Buries a blade into Laffy’s neck. Gets tangled up by Terry Tickle’s outstretched arms. Smashes off Poppo’s lower jaw. Before he knows it, he’s waist deep in the ball pit canal. Navigating the balloon forest. And that’s where he finds Moustache—hiding at the feet of an animatronic tiger wearing a British guard’s uniform. Bah... the longer you cower behind Sir Cuddlepuss, the more I'm gonna make this hurt.<br><br>Moustache makes a run for it. Jeffrey pulls a bottle of Afterpiece Tonic from his inner pocket. Gives it a swirl and hucks. Glass shatters. A thick cloud of fumes envelope Moustache. The man stumbles and coughs, looks around in confusion, crisscrosses his feet as if each one wants to go a separate way. Jeffrey socks the idiot in the side of the head, knocking him unconscious. Time to go home.

    HALLOWED BLIGHT
    The Voices
    Online, rumors about the murder are trending. An anonymous post claims that the victim was last seen alive at the Trickster's VIP meet-up after his concert in New York early this year. Yun-Jin remembers that night. Not because of the concert, but because of a detail that has been replaying in her mind ever since. Bleeding scratch marks on the Trickster's forearms when he showed up at the concert’s afterparty. The rumors online were rekindling the suspicion she silenced before. <br><br>Years ago, the Trickster and she arrived in Miami several days earlier than planned. Yun-Jin attended networking events while the Trickster rehearsed. Three days following their arrival, a folksinger was found dead downtown, near the bar where he performed. A security footage was released to the public showing a man dressed in black with his face covered, leading the singer down an alley. The dark, blurry footage revealed little about the suspect. But Yun-Jin noticed a detail that twisted her stomach in knots. She recognized the gold rimmed headphones around the suspect’s neck with two large “Xs”, one for each ear. It was the brand-new model of the Xerxes 1050x headphones, which few audiophiles knew about and even fewer could afford. She recognized the model right away because the Trickster favored their equipment over other expensive models. He wore a similar pair on the plane to Miami, but then switched to a lesser model for the rest of the tour, which only fueled her doubts. <br><br>Back then, however, she was not in a good place. The death of NO SPIN was still fresh. Acute insomnia kept her mind in a haze and the jet lag of the tour only worsened her state. In the end, she decided to let the police do their job and focus on hers; producing music. But now someone else was dead, someone whom the Trickster might have been the last one to see alive. The headphones, the scratch marks, and the late-night outs were details, but they added up. <br><br>How many coincidences does it take to know? <br><br>A knock on the door makes her jump. The head of security is here. Yun-Jin follows her gut. She confronts him. She bluffs about firing the whole security crew if he does not come clean. It pays off. She learns that the Trickster left the hotel premises last night. His bodyguard tried to follow but lost him on the way. <br><br>Yun-Jin pounds her fist on the table. <br><br> Why would he leave the hotel? To go where? And… to do what? <br><br>Despite working with the Trickster for years, he is still no more than a stranger. While he generates incredible profit, it comes at a cost. If the Trickster is linked to a murder, so is she. Even if there is no evidence. Even if it’s just rumors. It’s her life on the line. Her entire career. She could never produce music again. And the worst part is… it's her own fault. She knows better than to trust someone in this industry.  <br><br>She needs to get answers, before it is too late. Whatever the Trickster is doing at night, she must find out. Her doubts won’t be quieted until she knows for certain.

    Evan sketches his father in a bear suit drowning his mother. He never believed his father's story. Something didn't feel right. His eyes. His grin. His lack of empathy. She was pulled into a current and never seen again. His mother… she was beautiful. Blonde hair. Blue eyes. Fun. Full of compassion. His opposite. She didn't just go out to swim one morning and never come back. She was getting in his way and no one gets in his way. Not even family. Especially not family.   

Obedience or death. Evan's tired of obedience. Yes, he's loyal to his father but he's also loyal to his friends. They talk to him. Encourage him. Think he's a great artist. He has friends. He's never really had a friend. His father wouldn't allow it. Waste of time. They're using you. Yes, he's loyal to his father but he's also loyal to his friends. They deserve better.

    Jake swallows a piece of charred meat and stares beyond the flickering fire at the gutted hog. All he need to do now is salt the meat. Took the whole day to get him but it was worth it. There’s enough meat on him to last him months. The bloody and carved hog suddenly turns to Jake. But you didn’t really get me, did you? Jake blinks. And blinks, again. Truth is I let you catch me cause I figured you chased me long enough. Jake shakes his head in disbelief, and he knows his mind is still playing tricks on him despite having eaten. The hog sighs sadly. You and I, Jake, we’re caught in the same vicious cycle so don’t feel so bad, all right? Today it’s me. Tomorrow it’s you.  

Jake pinches himself but the hog continues. Chase something long enough and it will surrender itself to you. It will stop running and let you catch it so long as you stay the course. Just like that story you chased in the old country. Jake narrows his gaze on the grinning hog. Now you’re here on Blood Mountain trying to be your grandfather while trying to forget your father without realizing you’re both and neither of them at the same time.  

Jake tries to shake the hallucination out of his head. Don’t worry, Jake, I’m not really talking… you’re tired and dehydrated… and completely lost in the woods. I’m just trying to give you some perspective or rather… you’re trying to give yourself some perspective.  

Jake sighs deeply. I have no idea who I am or what I want to do and I’m talking to a dead hog in the middle of nowhere. The hog nods. Yes, you are. It’s interesting because your grandfather was poor and didn’t have many options and you’re not so poor and have too many options… I’m not sure which is worse… the tyranny of too little or the tyranny of too much… either way… a distracted life is a wasted life…  

It’s good that you came out here to figure things out. And you know what else is good? If you let go… if you just let go…  

I have let go and I’m still as lost as I ever was.  

The hog snorts. You haven’t let go, Jake. You’re still playing the old scripts over and over again like a broken record. But let’s see… you like chasing stories… especially the hidden ones… you talk to yourself constantly… and you like being alone… maybe you’re a writer, Jake. Or maybe you’re a historian. 

Jake laughs out loud. Are you kidding me! I hate history, and I failed every English class in high school cause I thought the rules were stupid and the teachers were boring.  

You and every other writer that actually made a dent. English class doesn’t make a writer, Jake… Fighting class and dancing class do.   

I don’t even know what that means!  

It means you need guts and style, not grades and diplomas. It means you need courage and not the validation of some coward that doesn’t know what it’s like to lead someone on a dancefloor or step into a ring. It means your country needs a lot more stories like yours. Because let’s face it, Jake, if your story isn’t in the main narrative… if you’re just a footnote in a history book… you may as well not exist.  

You’re not your grandfather, Jake. You’re not your father either. And every generation has its challenge. Oppression. War. Separation. Maybe the challenge of your generation is… representation. You gotta get your stories out there whether you’re a writer, historian, filmmaker or producer. Seems to me a lot of kids like you in the new country need to hear your story or stories like yours to know they aren’t alone. To know they belong and that they aren’t outsiders in their own home.  

A chorus of howls brings Jake back to the moment. Wolves! And they’re coming for what’s mine! They howl again, and above the racquet he hears his father’s voice. In every transaction, Jake, there are wolves.  

Not in this one.  

Especially this one.  

Jake ignores the voice in his head and tries to focus as he considers his next move carefully.

    A sadistic and merciless executioner, Pyramid Head is fixated on dispensing punishment through pain.<br><br>Encumbered by the steel frame upon his head and with a hulking great blade in tow, he stalked the hellish corridors of Silent Hill, committed to a duty that no one truly understood.

When his duty was complete and his presence no longer needed, he prepared for the long rest—and yet, his skills were required elsewhere.<br><br>The Fog that streamed over him was somehow different than that he was accustomed to in Silent Hill, as if each wisp contained the nerves of a creature, writhing, seeking him out. There was an unspoken agreement in that moment. The billowing cloud was an invitation to duty and sadism, and Pyramid Head, stepping into The Fog, accepted his obligation once more.

    Vault over the pallet
    Chamber of Blood. Harbinger of Hell. Beneath the Ruins 1.<br><br>Stefan sipped his cold Turkish coffee as he read over his early-morning efforts toward a short story he hoped to share on his blog. He read the opening lines and decided they could be stronger. With a sigh, he tore the yellow page from the legal pad, crumpled it into a ball and tossed it into a growing pile of false-starts in the middle of the opulent, black and burgundy hotel room. He slammed the desk, frustrated, and wanted to write something fun and original for his blog, yet nothing came to him. The latest episode sponsored by their mysterious benefactor had his production team investigate ancient tombs in South-West, Turkey. Not so much him. But his niece and nephew, who had tougher nerves for the macabre.  

Stefan much preferred a safe and cozy hotel room where he could raid the mini-bar and see to the logistics of the show.  It wasn't that he didn't like adventure. It was more that he didn't like graves, tombs or places that felt dark, creepy and dangerous.  Haddie had once suggested that he wrote horror stories as a kind of therapy to work out his fears and anxieties of the unknown. She was half right. The other half was that he simply liked to be alone—alone with all the characters and voices chattering in his head, voices that demanded to be heard and set to paper.  

Now the voices were compelling him to write a vampire story. Their benefactor claimed that there had been a village of real vampires in ancient Anatolia that had been hidden from the rest of the world. According to the intelligence provided, vampires weren't fictional monsters but actual intra-dimensional creatures that had once tried to overrun the world. They had been defeated by an unknown group of mystical warriors. Somehow the few creatures that had survived managed to erase themselves from history by warping and weaving whatever memory of them was left into exaggerated myths and legends.  

Stefan found this theory of myths and legends and parallel worlds interesting if not intriguing.  

Vampires real.  

Actually, real.  

Nothing like the movies, but real nevertheless.  

One theory he had just finished reading online suggested that everything created or imagined existed somewhere in the 'Garden of Infinity.'  In other words, stories and characters came from a real place in the infinite landscape that was the omniverse.  

The theory went on to suggest that artists had somehow unlocked their third eye and were able to see into other realities.  An idea, a vision, or a dream, according to the theory, was the pineal gland seeing into the infinite for truth, wisdom, inspiration. The brain, then, was a quantum computer that could network with the infinite. It was a nice idea. It meant that his most cherished characters from his favorite books… were somehow… somewhere… real. A sudden knock at the door startled him out of his quantum musings.  

"Mr. Roi… Your lunch is ready."  

Lunchtime already and Stefan still didn't have his story. He rose lazily in his bathrobe, hoping Jordan and Haddie had better luck finding the unmarked graves they had set out to find. He imagined his niece and nephew were enjoying the sun while filming the ruins and enjoying the peanut butter and banana sandwiches he had prepared for them.

    Misato smiles at Yui.  Maybe it wasn't a dream. Maybe it was a glimpse into another world, a world where you take a completely different path.  In one you become a vengeful, red-eyed brute and in another a coward that doesn't follow her dreams.  Yui shakes her head. I don't believe in any of that multi-world magical bullshit.  Misato scrunches her face when she hears magic. Not magic, quantum... quantum bullshit. Misato munches on peanuts and sips her beer. If it's a dream it probably has something to do with something you are moving away from, something you left behind. What do the cliffs signify? Yui remembers a moment with her grandmother. She remembers she was at a recreational center with her friends and cousins. She lost a relay race because her best friend stopped to see if their competitor was okay when he tripped and fell. Her teammate helped the boy up while another team took the lead and won the race. She was furious and they hadn't spoken for weeks. Yui remembered going to the precipice where they liked to talk hoping she would be there, but she wasn't. Her grandmother went up to see her and listened to her side of the story and sided with her friend.  

Yui vaguely remembered the talk. Her grandmother sat beside her, staring below at the jagged rocks, laughing nervously. You love danger... and more than danger you love winning. Always have, always will. But winning isn't everything, Yui. Tell me... what's the use of winning if you lose all your friends? Who are you going to share your victories with?  Yui laughs at this and calls her best friend weak. Her grandmother places a concerned hand on her shoulder. She's not weak. I would say she's quite the opposite to sacrifice winning to help someone in need. Empathy is what makes us human and if you lose this you are... you are just a very good machine that wins. What does it matter if you gain the world if you lose your humanity? Yui closes her eyes and knows her grandmother is right, and yet... there's something inside her that hates to lose, that refuses to lose, something that will drive her to win despite it all.  A thing that brings out the best and worst in her.

    The series featuring Haddie and Jordan on Terra 717 or Haley and Jaden on Terra 1315, or even Hannah and Justin on Terra 238 are all titled ‘HarbingerFM’ instead of ‘The Harbinger of Hell,’ and they seem to have more insight on what The Entity might be and how it corrupts and influences other worlds. Other Terra Worlds have quite unique and sometimes contradictory versions of the Harbinger series which make them difficult to track and interpret. But despite the discrepancies, each version seems to feature siblings trying to expose a nefarious cult devoted to The Entity.  

I am currently searching the rift for the real memories that inspired all these adventures to see how close they are to the actual inspiration. I’m even wondering if Haddie and Jordan are here, trapped in The Entity, and, if they are, I’m hoping their memories will somehow help me find a way out of here. So far, I have found nothing close to a real memory, but I did find another story from Terra 717 in which Haddie discusses a phenomenon she calls ‘The Overlap’ and which other stories call The Borro, The Coil, The Bleed, etc.  

I’m currently keeping extensive notes on the Harbinger stories and their descriptions of The Overlap to see if any of them can give me insight into what this phenomenon actually is. What I’ve discovered so far is that almost all of these stories describe places where a dark dimension intersects with the world and that these intersections seem to attract tragedy and misfortune. Some of these stories go so far as to claim ‘broken’ or ‘traumatized’ people can derive strange abilities from the vibrations emanating from these dark and ‘cursed’ places. These people can ultimately use The Bleed—my preferred name for the phenomenon—to access knowledge beyond the veil as it were.  

The Harbinger series from Terra 719 is also worth noting because the details included by the author seem closest to what we studied back home concerning Ancients and living dimensions, not to mention what I’ve been able to discover by examining the memories of souls marooned here. Piece by piece, or rather, story by story, I’m getting closer to salvation... or insanity… whichever comes first.

    To understand the human condition, one must rise above it. This was the credo of Talbot Grimes, a Scottish chemist whose unrestrained ambition took him to towering heights. As a boy, he was a popular child—bright, charismatic, and unafraid to challenge authority—yet despite his social graces he was fiercely independent, spending much of his time exploring the sprawling fields near his town alone. What began as a child's curiosity nearly turned deadly after experimenting with a patch of poisonous foxglove. For days, he laid in bed dripping with sweat, purging any food that touched his stomach. When he recovered, it wasn't fear that gripped him, but fascination. There was something magical in how a single flower could so drastically affect him.<br><br>Into his adult years, his ambition developed as quickly as his questionable methods. He attended the London School of Medicine and excelled despite several reprimands. His willingness to push the limits secured him a position with the British East India Company, and within seven years he was made head chemist. In time, he completed one of his greatest achievements: a chemical that could increase a worker's productivity while reducing their need for rest. He was rewarded with a secret laboratory beneath a prison camp on Dyer Island.<br><br>There, off the coast of India, prisoners from the Opium War became his unwilling subjects, leading to a drug that allowed soldiers to withstand incredible amounts of pain. Though most side effects were minor, there were rumors that a small number of soldiers went mad. In feral states, they massacred villages, impaling the populace on bayonets, leaving them hanging from trees. There were no official reports on the subject, and Talbot refused to blame himself for what could only be exaggerated war stories.<br><br>Though his callous brilliance seemed unflappable, he was ignorant to the enemies his questionable work had amassed. The realization struck him quite literally—with a steel pipe to the back of his head during a trip to Mangalore. He was bound and loaded into a wagon. When his blindfold was removed, a sickly man showed him a mass grave filled with hundreds of bodies. Unbeknownst to Talbot, his productivity-increasing drug had killed nearly an entire factory's worth of workers. He knew he couldn't defend himself against the anger and accusations of his abductor—all he could do was curl up as the blows from the steel pipe rained down. His body was thrown into the grave and left for dead. Shifting between consciousness and the darkest black, he crawled for an escape, fingers sinking into rotting flesh. Black flies feasted on his uncovered skin, the sensation of a hundred pin pricks stabbing into him. As he collapsed, he came face to face with a dead woman’s dazzling hazel eyes. Too weak to pull away, he could do nothing but witness his life’s work.<br><br>Then, from the edge of death, he was brought back. He found himself on a small bed as a kindly, wrinkled face looked over him. With each pained breath, he was nursed back to health in an ancient mystery school posing as a monastery. In verdant gardens behind tall, unassuming walls, monks studied forbidden texts, striving to expand the human mind in the search for other dimensions—believing one to be connected to the other.<br><br>Talbot’s knowledge proved indispensable, his mind-altering chemicals integrating seamlessly with theories of neural expansion. He realized then that his salvation was no coincidence—he was plucked from the pit specifically to advance the school’s knowledge. He agreed to help until his recovery was complete, being tasked with researching what the monk’s called the soul chemical, a compound derived from the pineal gland that could open the mind’s eye. What began as a favor to his saviors, soon became an obsession. Poring over the school’s archives of lost texts, he uncovered scientific formulas that confirmed previously unthinkable ideas. He dreamt of ushering humankind into a new period of enlightenment. Perhaps then, the nightmares of hundreds of dead factory workers—and of those two hazel eyes—would fade from his mind.<br><br>As he came closer to a breakthrough, the demeanor of the monks shifted. The gentle smiles they offered were paired with uneasy eyes that quickly darted away when spotted. The polite conversations he was once privy to turned to hushed murmurs. The last thing he would see of the school was the cracked ceiling above his bed, branching like a dendrite through plaster.<br><br>His next memories were a shattered mosaic of images and sensations. Smearing lights, horse hoofs on cobblestone, coarse burlap scratching at his cheeks, and sharp bites into his arm. He awoke ragged and unwashed, splayed on the straw mattress of an opium den. Mind in a dense fog, his first thought was of his notes, the only record of his groundbreaking revelations. He searched frantically, scrambling through the dingy basement, pleading aloud for help. The few other denizens looked up from their hammocks, offering nothing but drug-soaked eyes and apathetic gazes that soon fell into half-slumber. Before he noticed the robed figure appear behind him, a needle plunged into his arm and the world disappeared once more.<br><br>Awoken. Again. Each time, hazier than the last. He tongued at hollow gaps between his teeth. How long, he wondered. A faint memory returned. The soul chemical. His notes. The verge of a breakthrough. A faraway whisper entered his mind.<br><br>He fumbled with a stone, sharpening it with shaking hands. In the dim light of the den, amongst the catatonic occupants, he carved his research from memory into the walls. He wrote for hours until his fingers bled, moving to the floor, taking in everything the voice whispered despite his inability to comprehend it. When there was nowhere left to write, he gripped the stone and carved the message into his chest. Stained with blood, he witnessed a miracle appear before him—a magnificent field of lush, orange flowers. The whispered voice beckoned to him, urging him to enter the field and discover worlds and dimensions beyond human comprehension. For a moment, Talbot felt the sense of wonder he possessed as a child.<br><br>The denizens of the opium den awoke to silence, the dry scent of smoke still lingering in the air. Shambling out of their drug-hazed fog, they found the stone floor wet with blood, tiny rivulets coursing through the cracks. As eyes adjusted to the darkened room, the jagged lettering scrawled along its length began to appear. Written over and over without end, there was but one single line: <i>Death Is Only the Beginning</i>.

    Ridiculous limits. Skinner knew better. Put his own kid in some kind of a box for years just to see what it would do. Huxley worked for the secret service and wrote truths as lies in Brave New World. War of the Worlds was another great test in mass propaganda. The power of the radio to induce fear and anxiety in an unsuspecting audience. The power of fear and anxiety to inspire silence and indifference and create perfect consumers. Ethics. Morality. Limits. For sheep, not shepherds.<br><br>Carter feels anxiety unlike he ever felt as he watches good-doctor interrogate one of his classmates. He approaches him from behind with a piece of wood.  Something he found on the ground. Raises the make-shift club. Before he realizes what he’s doing he pounds the good-doctor’s head. Pretend fear becomes real fear as his fellow students stare at him in horror. No more good-doctor. No more rules. No more limits… except the limits of his imagination.

    I've found scattered about this tower countless journals from previous occupants. Occupants might not be the best way to describe them. Prisoners would be more fitting. Eight or nine of them from the distinct voices I deciphered in the manifold journals I read with surprising interest and alacrity. Some of these unknown prisoners shared my unusual penchant for beer, whiskey and stories of the macabre. Others seemed to be raving lunatics writing not journals but senseless notes—notes from the absurd I call them—strange musings and endless contradictions about places and characters observed and consciously or unconsciously improperly described. These notes from the absurd seem to start with unintelligible gibberish are quite different from anything I've seen or read, as though written by someone driven by madness or some other motive to undermine any attempt to make sense of this world. Along with the notes I found illustrations and survivor statements from police files and thousands of short stories in a dark chamber in the basement.  They had been piled up and set ablaze but quickly extinguished with some sort of a putrid, rotting sludge. I cleaned the chamber and stacked all the stories in piles to go through and organize at a later date. For the time being I see no reason to remove them from what I am now calling the Chamber of Blood.

    Minutes don’t feel like minutes. They feel like hours… days… Three minutes and Ace wants to throw in the towel, but his pride won’t let him. His common sense is telling him to quit before she breaks another rib. He gets the sense he won’t be laughing to the bank but to the hospital. But he can’t give up. He won’t give up, and he certainly won’t lose this bet. He’s going to win even if winning kills him. For a moment he half-remembers a quote about sitting on a stove with a pretty girl or a pretty girl cooking at the stove or something about a pretty girl and a stove. He’s getting it all wrong, but he knows it has something to do with time. Mika smashes a fist straight into his puffy face and he staggers back and nearly buckles over. He manages to keep his balance and tries to smile but just as soon as his lips part he somehow finds himself on the hard floor staring at a crowd that seems miles away, laughing as they give him a count in unison. He rolls on his belly and pushes himself up, groggy, and spaghetti kneed. It’s going to take a lot more than that to keep me down.
    The perfect blend of performance material and comfort.

    Jake figures an hour or so has passed and he’s noticed no movement or attempt to escape. This is a worthy adversary. He thinks he can outwait me.  

It’s a good plan… He might actually escape. I’m betting on the hog.  

You’ll lose, bro.  

Jake considers his options, then grabs a small shovel out of his rucksack and begins to dig a pit. He feels cobalt eyes watching him and he grins to himself. It will take a bit of time... but this deadfall will put the odds in my favor.  

The people his grandfather helped said he dug a tunnel under a small clearing to avoid detection… He dug a tunnel… Digging a small pit is nothing in comparison.  

What I don’t understand is… you brought a shovel… and matches but no granola bars…  What the hell were you thinking?  

I guess I wasn’t.  

You’re a walking contradiction, Jake.   

I guess.  

The stupid shit we do when we’re lost and alone.  

I’m not lost or alone… I’m exactly where I want to be.  

Yeah, yeah. The whole turn your back on civilized living because humanity and not you have lost your way. Make yourself believe whatever you want... but in the end... he’s your father.   

He didn’t even try to reach out to me! 

You didn’t try to reach out to him.  

He kicked me out!  

You poked and twisted an old wound. You hit a nerve and he reacted.  

His father was a hero!  

Maybe he didn’t want a hero, Jake. Maybe he just wanted a father... A living, breathing father to do shit with… kinda like what you got.

    Chamber of Blood. Harbinger of Hell. Beneath the Ruins 2.<br><br>"Move away from the casket!" A middle-aged woman with blonde hair and blue eyes dressed in a black suit pointed a revolver at Haddie and Jordan. Haddie dropped her shovel, sighed, exchange a look with her brother and stepped away from the bolted casket.   

"Who do you work for?" Haddie asked, eying the woman.  

"That, my dear, does not concern you." 

Jordan shook his head. "I don't think you should open it."  

"Shut-up!"  

"My brother's right." Haddie pointed at the symbols etched all in the rotten wood of the casket. "It's a warning of some kind… whatever's in there… is meant to stay in there."  She scrutinized the half-crescent and three dots and wondered what they meant. They didn't resemble any of the other symbols she had come across in the last few months.  

"Superstitious nonsense!" The woman yelled, aimed the revolver at the bolt and pulled the trigger. A report echoed through the ruins and the surrounding forest. 

Haddie wondered if their guide and translator had heard them. He probably didn't even take notice or didn't care. He refused to follow them near the tombs, called them ignorant tourists, and said he would stay by the car texting his friends until they returned. The woman pulled the trigger repeatedly until the bolt clanged off and hit the ground with a thud.  

"I hope he calls the police," Jordan whispered to Haddie.  

"I wouldn't count on it…"  

The woman examined the casket carefully. Haddie and Jordan inched backward as she struggled to yank the lid open. As Haddie cautiously backed away, she figured the woman worked for the same secret society that had now interfered with several of her investigations.  

She didn't know much about them, but from what she had gathered by overhearing a few of their goons in Egypt was that they were searching for hidden knowledge—knowledge they believed would help humanity transcend to another plane of existence.   

"Please…" Haddie cautioned. "Don't open it until we know what the symbol means."  

The goon scoffed and, with a labored scream, yanked the lid open to reveal— 

Nothing.  

Nothing but a strange black mist.  

"I don't understand," she said. "It's supposed to be here… the book…"   

The goon's eyes narrowed. Frustration creased her face as black mist suddenly rose and spiralled into her mouth and nose as though it were alive.  

Haddie and Jordan stepped out of the grave. 

The woman gagged, coughed and collapsed. There in the dirt, she jerked and twitched in all kinds of unnatural directions, screaming and shrieking as the mist reshaped her body into something indescribably grotesque. Her veins stood out thick and black in her neck. Her hands smashed the ground, and she went into hysteric convulsions as though being burned alive.  Then, with a blood-curdling scream, her body went limp and silent. 

Haddie repressed a cry of horror. She felt a cold prickle run down her spine as she stared at the scene in disbelief. What was going on? What strange mist could do such a thing to a person?  Was it some kind of ancient poison… some kind of toxic vapor… or was it something worse…  

"Well… you don't see that every day, do you?" Jordan said flatly. "I seriously wish I got that on my phone."  

Haddie sighed. "Is she dead?" 

"Dead as a tomb."  

Haddie didn't find him funny. Not in the least. He was scared. She could tell by his desperate attempt to use humor to hide his fear. He was just about to crack another joke when the creature suddenly twitched back to life.  

Startled, Haddie gasped and pulled at Jordan's t-shirt, saying, "We need to get out of here." But just as she stepped back, the creature turned to face them with blood-red eyes and a jaw protruding like a snout with teeth that seemed to be growing underneath stretched skin.  

"Oh shit!" Haddie blurted. She lost her footing, and fell to the ground with her brother.  The creature that had once been a woman roared at them, revealing two massive fangs like carving knives.

    Your Pa says you wanna know your name! Stop running and I'll tell you your fuckin  name! Boy stops running. The barking of dogs grows louder and louder. He turns toward Chief's voice and sees moonlight dappling through branches and leaves. He shifts about in the silence not sure what to do. Chief's voice grows louder. Your Pa gave you a name before he realized you were a crooked freak of fuckin nature! Your name shame him! That's why he hides you! You want to know your name, come out with your hands up and I'll tell you!  Before Boy realizes what's happening a dog rushes out of the darkness and attacks his arm with a vicious mouth of sharp teeth and dripping slobber. Boy wheels toward a vague, fast-moving shadow and grabs the wrist before the hammer crashes down on his head. He throws the dog against a tree. He's never felt such strength, such power, such resolve. I have a name! He shakes the wrist and the hammer falls with a thud in the gloom below.  
Boy wrestles Chief to the ground. Chief pulls out a knife. Boy grabs Chief's wrist and forces him to plunge it into his own belly. See my worth now, Chief! See my worth!   Chief pulls the bloody knife out. But Boy doesn't give him a chance to react. He plunges his hand into his warm gut and squeezes something he doesn't quite recognize.  Chief shrieks in agony. Son of a bitch! The dogs leap at Boy and rip him off Chief before he can do more damage. Boy smashes the dogs to the ground and searches for his hammer to finish his good work. Dogs slowly rouse and bark. He grabs a branch. Smashes them hard and charges away before they attack again. He runs for what feels like forever through the cold, dark woods and heads toward the farm... toward the house where he always should have lived. It's still not too late. There are secret rooms in the basement, rooms where his Pa hid his money and where his Pa and Ma could hurt him without anyone hearing his screams. He bets he could hide there a long time before anyone ever found him. He bets it would be real cozy especially with his TV. And he bets he'll find his name, his real name, in his Pa's stuff. But not before he cooks himself some bacon... some prized bacon.

    Two rights in a nose that’s already broken. She clearly doesn’t want to lose. She wants to knock him out but that won’t happen. Ace won’t let it happen. Outclassed in every way except guts, he clambers to his feet. He tries to smile at her. That didn’t hurt. But it did. It really did. Before his smile breaks he finds himself in a headlock. Shit, she’s fast! Mika twirls him around like a sack of potatoes and thrusts him into a table. The table breaks. So does something in his chest. He thinks it’s a rib, but he didn’t think he had any more that could be broken. He gets up, manages a grin, and charges her. Grabs her rock-hard arms. Pins her to the wall. A surge of adrenalin fills his entire being. He’s got her now. He shoots his fist out at her face. She drops to the side, and he shatters his hand against the stone wall as he feels her lift him off the ground. A moment later she twirls and throws him into the crowd with his broken hand swelling and throbbing with every heartbeat. The crowd scatters and lets him fall hard on the ground. Something cracks. He hopes it’s not a bone. Everything is distorted. He feels like he’s underwater listening to a muted crowd hollering for him to get back up or stay down. He can’t quite tell anymore. He stands and stares at the timer, feels a sharp pain in his mouth and senses an awkward gap. My tooth! My fuckin tooth! He looks around the floor and sees his front tooth lying in a glop of blood and saliva. It’s still attached to the roots. He glances over the amused and entertained crowd and finds Wallace looking pale and frightened as Mika suddenly cuts through him like chafe.

    The Invokist comes forward: small, wrinkled man, buried under a scarlet—no, white but bloody—cloak. Adiris bows her head, joins the whispers around her. May you swim through sea and stars. The Invokist stands over the man bound to the altar. Nods. Pulls a sleeve back. Reveals a spear gripped in hand. Raises the weapon and... plunges! The tip pierces the bound man's lower back. He arches upwards and screams, shakes, convulses, lower body remaining immobile, bladder emptying onto the altar. The Invokist hefts his leg onto the stone slab, pushes the spear until—a gruesome snap. Shrieking... howling... pleading? Something beyond that—indescribable. A vertebrae bursts from the gaping wound. Blood gushes.<br><br>Bile rises in Adiris’ throat as she turns away to stop herself from retching. Her fellow emissaries look upwards. Praise!

    I tremble as I scribble this down. Squid-like creatures difficult to describe attempt to penetrate my tower, trying to destroy my study and tools to explore and manifest. I held them off for as long as I could, then, taking the Auris and other valuables, I rushed through a doorway and hid in a lost realm. When I returned, the tower was upside-down, my study completely ransacked, the creatures lay dead on the floor with black, putrid blood leaking out of them, and the smell of decaying fish was everywhere. What are these creatures and who is sending them if not this brutish monster of an Old One. I spent hours cursing and throwing these fetid carcasses out of my window and back into the abyss.

    Boy squeezes the neck so tight screams quickly fade into pathetic whimpers. Easier to kill a man than a cow. Only a man makes much more of a fuss. Boy stares in the deputy's panicking eyes and knows this one. Knows him well. This one laughed at him many times. Laughed at him when he should have helped him. Who's laughing now! Didn't you watch TV. The police are supposed to help, not hurt.  Laugh at me now! Boy lifts him off his feet and pounds the back of the head against a tree. Over and over again! Laugh now! Laugh! Laugh! The skull splits open like a melon and brain mass hangs from one side. Boy releases him and the dying deputy can barely keep his balance. He toddles left and right and stops in front of Boy. For a moment he stares at him as though seeing something more than a tool or a freak show. Something smarter than a mule. Smarter and deadlier. The deputy seems lost and confused... like a mindless zombie on TV. The trembling, confused deputy shuffles forward feeling his wet mushy head. Boy moves to the side to let him pass and stares at his good work. Stares at the gore dripping from his skull like putty. Watches him stagger left and right in the moonlight. If he were a cow, he'd end his suffering. But he's not a cow. He's something else. Something vile and corrupt. Boy watches him disappear in the shadows.  He stares at the darkness until he hears a thud. A strange feeling fills his heart and he... laughs. Feels good to fight back and show them his worth—his real worth.

    Nea skates over to Falls City park, searching for her friend Casey but doesn't find her. She skates to her home and her mother says she's in The Narrows handing out water bottles with a grassroots organization calling themselves Life Drop. Life Drop? The Narrows? What's Casey gotten herself into this time? You know Casey, probably some save-the-bees organization that just doesn't understand the way the world works. No such thing as the American Dream anymore, only the Corporate Dream and the Corporate Dream and the American Dream ain't the same thing. She's read about The Narrows… supposed to be the poorest and most polluted district in Falls City.  Maybe it's because it's the poorest that it's also the most polluted. Maybe it's because of corrupt yet legal policy against those who can't afford the big lawyers to change or challenge the corrupt policy. Paper mills. Car factories. Toxic waste facilities. All dumping on the land and water. A few politicians set the dollar price to poison the environment and an entire community of blue-collar workers pay the price, the ultimate price, with their health and lives. Nothing new. Same old, same old. The fat-cats and bureaucrats keep doing it because they can. So long as there's money to be made in poisoning the world, someone will be there to make it. That's everywhere, every city she ever read about, and Falls City ain't no exception. She used to care, but then there was too much to care about, and so she decided it was easier not to care anymore. Funny how that happened. All she cares about now is skateboarding and finding the impossible place to tag. Whatever, maybe she'll find something to tag in The Narrows. She skates down the street following Upper Falls River toward the poorest and most polluted district in Falls City.

    CROWD CHOICE
    Ace dives under a table for refuge as Mika grabs him by the ankle and pulls him out. She lifts him over her head, twirls him and breaks him against another table. He stands, turns to face her, shakes his head until he clears his vision. He lurches and throws a left at one of the three faces he sees. Mika ducks and delivers a slashing right hook to the body then drops him with a devastating right hook. He rolls over the ground, wheezing, feeling his jarred and jutting ribs. He probably should be dead. He doesn’t even want to think about the hospital bill. Hospital? He doesn’t need a hospital. He hasn’t seen a doctor in ten years and certainly doesn’t need one now. His body can heal on its own. He pushes himself up but doesn’t feel much below the waist. He shoots a weak punch with his good hand. Mika grabs his fist mid-air and crushes his fingers into a mangled mush. Mercilessly she grabs his arm and… pops his elbow. He screams with blood gurgling out of his mouth. She wants him down even if it means killing him.  

Ace suddenly realizes... Mika made her own bet. His entire body floods with endorphins as he wobbles around Uh, Ohs spinning floor. A glance at the timer reveals he’s only got twenty seconds left. He’s going to win even if he loses every bone in his body. What more can this kitten do to me? He clambers back to his feet and smiles with blood gushing out of his mouth. She charges him like a wildcat and is a whirlwind of devastating blows. He’s hit a dozen times and flattened with a wicked uppercut. The crowd is screaming and hollering for Mika to lay him out for good. But Ace won’t lose his gator tooth even if it cost him his real tooth.  

Seconds pass like minutes. The bell sounds. It’s over. It’s finally over. Ace collapses. Wallace stares down at him with a newfound respect and a wad of cash in his hands. Ace stares at the money and manages to mumble something. You bastard... you bet on me? Wallace pulls Ace up and hands him his tooth. Put this in your mouth to keep the nerves moist.

    I pity Dwight. It's as though every action he takes brings the opposite of what he intends. Trying to help his fellow employees from an abuser he ends up shutting down the entire operation, leaving many in a far worse situation than they ever were in. Granted, spiking a narcissist's drink and watching him unravel was worth the price of admission.  The many memories of survivors struggling with narcissists have led me to the conclusion that there are only three possibilities when relating to a narcissist. Enable them. Run away from them. Or… destroy them. But beware, narcissists take everyone with them when they go down.

    There are dead bodies in my study and I have no recollection of the last few days. The bodies have been flayed from head to toe and the faces have been beaten to an unrecognizable pulp. I dragged them to the window and thrust them out into the abyss wondering who they were and why they were in my tower. Did I manifest them? Did I create them for company? Or did they come from somewhere else? Had I been the one who butchered them? Had I lost myself so deeply in a memory that I became someone else for a short time? Perhaps they are not my creations but apparitions from the fog sent by The Entity like the creatures I hear lurking about in the fog now and then.

    Lazar is spreading rumors about Rose. Dwight consoles her but she's inconsolable. She says it's a pattern. His pattern. He discredits, destroys, and demolishes an employee before he fires them. He spreads the rumor he later uses to fire the person. Dwight says she's exaggerating. Rose shakes her head. Lazar's in trouble. He just spent more money on a one-minute ad campaign for Peak 22 than a Hollywood blockbuster and his investors want answers. He needs a fall girl. Someone to blame for the mismanagement of company funds. Dwight doesn't understand. She explains that Lazar's already left a trail of blood in his wake. The last three women in her position were all promoted and fired for Lazar's excesses and stupidities. Lazar has an upcoming meeting with his investors. She will be this year's patsy. Dwight gives her a skeptical look. She shakes her head. You'll see. He spends the money. A woman takes the fall. That's Lazar's idea of equal opportunity.

    Chamber of Blood. Harbinger of Hell. Evil Eyes. 5.<br><br>Haddie charged toward the mouth of the cave with millions of eyes and chattering teeth on her heels. She felt the swipes at her back but never wavered. She vaulted wildly out the mouth just as one creature lunged at her. Haddie tumbled out of the cave as the creature hit an invisible barrier where the overlap of dimensions ended. She turned to see the dark mouth of the cave fill with scathing red eyes.  

Jordan stepped up behind her. “Helly Haddie, does it again,” he said with a laugh.   

Haddie gave her brother a dirty look. “Don't call me that,” she said curtly. Even though he had meant no harm, it was a name along with 'The Harbinger of Hell' children used to call her because bad luck, strange things and unexplainable accidents seemed to follow her. Years of therapy gave her the courage to accept her abilities and to boldly call her series the Harbinger of Hell.   

Exhausted, Haddie sat on a sun-baked stone and watched the red eyes slowly disappear from the gloom of the cave. “Did you catch the creature on your shirt cam?” 

Jordan shook his head as he sat beside her. She didn't think he would as creatures or relics from other worlds didn't register and often left blurs or glitches.  

Jordan sighed and handed over the relic they had recovered. “What do you make of it?”  

Haddie held it and felt great misery. In her mind's eye she saw cloaked figures hiding pieces of the same pillar in another world. She shrugged and kept what she had seen to herself. Then she pulled out her cellphone and handed it to Jordan. He centered her in the frame and indicated he was filming.   

Haddie cleared her throat, mopped her forehead of sweat and soot, looked into the lens, and proceeded to address her online followers:  

“My name is Haddie and I was born with a wonderful curse. All my life I've attracted strange and unusual things, and when I was twelve, I realized I was able to acquire insight to unexplainable events and otherworldly places.”  

She took a moment to calm her racing heart. She swallowed her fear, remembered she had a series to sell, and forced energy and pep into her voice. “What do you need to know about India? It's where my father grew up and it's where I am today to explore the urban legends of this amazing country.”  

Haddie took a moment to find her words.   

“Our adventure begins in Northern India at a strange place locals call The Eyes or the Valley of Evil Eyes where hundreds have disappeared or died including a unit of British soldiers in the 1800s. What happened to these soldiers? Where did they disappear to? And is there any merit to the accounts of a cave-dwelling demon with eyes around its head that burn right through the soul?” 

Haddie stared meditatively into the camera and wanted to say 'yes' to every one of her questions but decided it was better to leave them up to interpretation. After a dramatic pause, she finished, “Take a look at what we discovered. Judge the evidence for yourself… and see if there is any truth to the Evil Eyes of the Himalayas.”

    Power is in the mind—the eye of the mind as the mystics called it. The eye that lets us dream and visualize is more than we think it is. Much more. It is a key and it opens doors... Endless doors.... and the key is a secretion...  a sacred secretion like a drug to travel within the endless worlds within the swirling chaos that is infinite life. Blasphemy! Take your ideas out of this school! They belong to the devil! He takes his ideas to The Company and says the secretion is better than opium. He tells them there is no experience like it and he calls it the Dragon's Doorway. Makes the high from the poppy seem like cough syrup. He remembers the mystics. The unknown mystics. Mystics who chant hymns in the hope they will die with the right vibration. Right vibration? What does it mean to die with the right vibration? It means they believe different vibrations open different doorways to realms unknown. Death opens the doorway… and the dragon carries you away. The Company is interested. How would you harvest such an opioid if it's only secreted upon death? I'll find a way. And he does… only they find him before he can complete his life's work. He vaguely remembers being bludgeoned to death and thrown in a mass grave of corrupting bodies. And… he remembers being saved… by nine mystics in thick, dark tunics… Where are the nine now? What have they done with my research? Why did they try to stop me? Questions… so many questions… Where is my flower… in your mind… he thrusts his fingers into his sockets and tears out his eyes and digs deep into his head… searching for a flower… one flower…

Joey and Susie are out messing with the sheep of Ormond as usual. They soon enter with a bunch of stop signs and laugh about the accidents they caused. No one dead but some serious injuries. Six to be precise. They snapped some pictures to capture the moment. Joey then tells them he got a new job at the local hardware store. They all make bets on how long he'll keep this job. Julie appraises the space and has an idea. She'll decorate the walls with the emblems they pulled off the cars of Ormond. Everyone likes the idea. Joey adds he wants to put hang the stop signs on the wall. Inspired by the small traffic accidents Joey and Susie engineered, Julie suggests another name for their little gang. The Marauders of Mayhem. Frank shakes his head and his eyebrows frown. Too tough on the tongue. Joey disagrees. I love it. All eyes turn to Susie. She shrugs. I agree with Frank… it's a mouthful.

    Evan is fourteen years old and he knows something his father doesn't. The thought thrills him. Amazes him. Scares him. There is something his father doesn't know. Something the owner of one of the most profitable mines in all of Seattle doesn't know.<br><br>His father manages his workers with an iron fist. No. Not an iron fist. Brass knuckles.  He calls them maggots. Groveling maggots. He's about to discover he's wrong. They're more than maggots. Much more. They're men. And men working together can bring change. One of these men is inspiring others to take their lives back. If they can stand together, maybe just maybe they can bring in the union. With the union they'll have rights. More than rights. They'll have dignity. Freedom. Time. Time to spend with their friends. Time to spend with their family. Time to be human. Evan knows something his father doesn't know… and he feels empowered.

    Survivors have 3 health states: <b>healthy</b>, <b>injured</b> and <b>dying</b>.<br>As a Killer, here's what each health state means to you:<br><br><b>Healthy</b>: The health state in which Survivors start. Successfully attacking a healthy Survivor puts them in the injured state.<br><br><b>Injured</b>: Even though they limp, injured Survivors have the same movement speed as when healthy. They leave behind trails of blood and make lots of noise which makes them easier to find. An injured Survivor who takes a second hit is put into the dying state.<br><br><b>Dying</b>: Survivors in the dying state can only crawl and are unable to interact or complete objectives. However, they are still able to escape if they can crawl to an opened Hatch or opened exit gate. Crawling Survivors can be picked up and placed on a hook to be sacrificed. If not healed, they will eventually bleed out and die.

    Showing exceptional aptitude in psychology, Herman was handpicked for special training in an advanced neuroscience program located in a secret black site facility in Illinois known as the Léry Memorial Institute, really a front for the CIA. This is where Herman met Dr. Otto Stamper where under his guidance, Herman began to use strange and ever increasingly vicious methods to extract information from prisoners sent to the institute, which was also a covert prison and re-education center for whoever was the USA’s current nemesis. His liberal use of violent electroshock therapy revealed dramatic results and several threats to national security were uncovered.<br><br>Over the years, Herman became known as The Doctor and no one ever questioned if he had even held a medical certificate or even what happened to the prisoners after they had given up their information. It was only after the Léry Memorial Institute went silent for a week that the true horror was finally discovered. The personnel, patients, and prisoners were all found dead with all types of head trauma. All personnel and prisoners' bodies were accounted for, including Dr. Otto Stamper, but no sign of Herman “The Doctor” Carter.<br>

    FIGHT CLUB
    Frank Morrison was nineteen and had little to show for it. He’d stopped attending school after being kicked out of the basketball team for shoving a referee into the stands. Yet Frank was a man of potential, who could light up a room despite his bleak childhood. At six years old, he’d been taken away from Calgary to start a circuit of foster homes. No matter how many times he’d lashed out, threw tantrums and got into fights, they’d kept moving him to new, unfamiliar houses. His last move had been three years prior when his last foster dad, Clive Andrews, had picked him up from the adoption center. They’d been on the road for seven hours before reaching a small bungalow in Ormond. It would be the longest time they’d spend together. Clive was too busy trading cheques from Family Services for drinks at the bar.<br><br>Ormond was a small, stale place; a remote town of six thousand inhabitants where gray winters drag on for most of the year. Frank did everything he could to get into another adoptive family, but he changed his mind when he caught the attention of a beautiful girl. Julie was a popular girl who was convinced that she deserved better than a life in Ormond, and Frank, as an outsider, was her ticket out. Frank attended the parties she threw where everyone was younger than him and easily impressed, which he liked. He met the impulsive Joey, who liked to show off, and the shy, naive Susie, who was Julie’s best friend.<br><br>They would hang out at an abandoned lodge up Mount Ormond. Their time together was the perfect break from the boring conformity of their small, insignificant everyday lives. Frank saw it as an opportunity to shape their lack of experience into something powerful. He lined up nights of debauchery and rampage, testing their limits. Bullying, vandalism, and theft were essentially their weekend plans. It came to a point where they would do anything he asked. Nothing was off-limits when they put their masks on. One evening, Frank dared Joey to vandalize the store that had recently fired him. They snuck inside easily enough as the building was supposed to be empty after closing hours. But a cleaner who was still there grabbed Julie as soon as she came near. Hearing her stifled cries, a dark impulse took over Frank. He rushed to her aid knife in hand and, without hesitating, planted the blade into the cleaner’s back.<br><br>As the group stared at Frank in shock, he ordered them to finish the job. Joey clenched his jaw, grabbed the knife, and stabbed the bleeding man in the ribs. Susie didn’t want to do it. Frank shouted at her; they had to finish what they’d started. Julie closed her eyes and jabbed the knife into the man’s chest. She handed the wet blade to Susie: they were all in this together now. Susie stared at Julie in disbelief as Frank grabbed her trembling hands and inserted the knife deep into the man’s throat. Frank told them to move fast: they mopped the blood off the floor, stashed the body in the trunk of Joey’s car and drove up Mount Ormond.<br><br>All four were digging in the muddy snow to dispose of the body when Frank spotted something moving through the woods. He grabbed his knife and broke from the group to check it out. The Fog thickened around Frank, becoming so dense that he soon could no longer see ahead. He retraced his steps and stumbled on an ominous trail. He followed the eerie path, as if called by the darkness. Julie, Susie, and Joey finished digging but Frank was nowhere to be seen. Julie spotted his muddy footsteps in the snow and the three of them followed the trail, which took them deeper into the woods. When Julie, Susie, and Joey did not return home that night, their parents thought they’d run away with Frank. Each family came up with a different theory. The mood of the town changed, however, when a body was found by an abandoned lodge up Mount Ormond.

    During a weekend at a cabin with friends, Ashley J. Williams uncovered the Necronomicon Ex-Mortis (the Book of the Dead) and awoke something dark in the woods. Evil possessed his friends, whom he was forced to kill, and his right hand, which he sawed off. For the next thirty years, Ash ran from his past, working at a Value Stop department store and seducing women in dive bars. But he screwed up one night while being high, when he read from the Necronomicon to impress a woman. Evil found him once more, wrecking the life of those around him. But his coworkers, Pablo who was raised by a shaman and Kelly who was orphaned by the Deadites, helped him put up a fight. While battling Evil, Ash was reunited with his long-lost daughter Brandy, who encouraged him to embrace his role as savior of humanity. After a terrible fight with a fully formed demon, Ash, drawing his last breath, was taken by the Knights of Sumeria and transported into the future.<br><br>Ash awakened to a voice, his head throbbing. Since defeating a gang of Deadites a week ago, he had been in a perpetual state of hangover. He heard the voice once more; a woman singing, sensual and inviting.<br><br>Stepping into the corridor in his boxers, he strode toward the voice, which lead to the public locker room. As Ash pushed open the door, the singing stopped. There was a rustling of curtains. He called out, entering the change room. His voice reverberated on the moldy tiled walls. He pressed on, reaching a shower that was still dripping wet. Cold, humid fingers ran down his bare back. He turned around.<br><br>A woman stood naked, her skin glistening in the morning light that streamed in from high windows. Ash recognized her instantly: Linda Emery, one of his former high school flings. They had gotten back together thirty years later, while saving their hometown from Evil. He had ended their relationship soon afterward, preferring to indulge freely in his new-found popularity.<br><br>Linda winked at Ash, who closed the distance between them. He caressed her cheek wistfully: <i>What was she doing here? Did she know anything about the whereabouts of his daughter? And Pablo and Kelly?</i><br><br>A sharp blade dug into his hand, making him jump back. Linda slid a finger across the edge of her blade, collecting Ash’s blood on her fingertip. She smiled, and her skin shriveled, her hair faded, her shoulders stooped, and her curves sagged, aging decades older in a matter of seconds. She attacked Ash, who poorly managed to block, being half-naked.<br><br>Every blow she delivered earned him a new wound. She slashed his bad knee and he fell to the floor. As she jumped on top of him, Ash shrieked in disgust, knocking the knife out of her grasp. Her varicose hands wrapped around his neck, strangling him. Gasping, he outstretched his arm, hand landing on a soap dispenser. He spurted out some liquid on his fingers and poked her in the eyes. The elderly woman winced, weakening her hold, and Ash elbowed her in the face, knocking her back. He rolled over and grabbed the knife on the floor. Just as he was about to plant it in her chest, he stopped. There was something else he wanted more.<br><br>He pressed the blade against her throat. <i>Let’s make a deal, demon. In exchange for not killing you, you portal me back to my friends.</i> The demon agreed.<br><br>She began reciting the incantation, instructing Ash to repeat after her, which he failed to manage. When nothing happened, Ash threatened the demon, who argued back, blaming his poor pronunciation. Their combined exchange of Sumerian words triggered a hiss from the showers behind them. The wet tiled floor darkened, and the pipes burst. A whirlpool of dirty water, shower curtains, and used toilet paper swallowed the demon, while Ash held onto a locker door, which slowly slipped from his fingers.<br><br><i>FFFUUUC—</i><br><br>Ash landed flat on his chest in the realm of The Entity, sputtering grass. He got up, brushing off the dry clothes he suddenly had on. Then he looked around and his grin fell. It was the kind of place that made two things obvious: one, there wasn’t any bar for miles, and two, he was going to need his shotgun and chainsaw, both of which he lacked. As he started to walk toward a glinting light ahead, a scream rippled through the trees.<br><br><i>Groovy.</i>

    Yun-Jin pours herself a cup of coffee at the recording studio, stifling another yawn. Her temples are throbbing. The jet lag is hitting her hard. Plus the constant threat of a crazed fan prevents her from getting any sleep at night.  <br><br>On her way back to the booth, she notices that the studio next to theirs is occupied. She peeks inside. A young man is laughing in the recording booth. He has an easy-going smile that could sell thousands of magazines. She recognizes the man at the mix table: Allano Muse, a semi-famous producer from San Diego. <br><br>What is he doing in Rio? Some bits of fresh gossip could help reenergize her. She taps on the door's window. <br><br>The door creaks open. <br><br>He remembers her of course. Who could forget the Magnum Opus? <br><br>She invites herself in as he plays the track he is working on. A slow, predictable build for the baseline. Formulaic. Too safe to be of any interest. Then, an ethereal voice fills the room. Yun-Jin almost spills her coffee. The artist's voice is crystalline. His range is powerful yet nuanced. <br><br>Who is that? <br><br>Allano tells Lucas, the young artist, to drop down his pitch a notch. Bad call. The track should be building up to push Lucas' range instead of confining it to a boring, generic sound. She walks up to Lucas and hands him her business card. <br><br>Contact me when you're ready to become a serious artist. <br><br>A pang of regret hits her on her way out. She said those exact words to the Trickster, many years ago. Back then, she looked forward to working with him. <br><br>Those days are long gone.

    It's always entertaining to watch a survivor try to escape with a femoral artery lacerated. Some victims actually get quite far before shock and cardiac arrest overwhelm them. They fight and struggle for life as if death were final. Perhaps this is the reason The Entity wipes the slate clean with every resurrection. The unwavering belief that death is real gives weight and gravitas to the trial… to the experience. Otherwise survivors won't care. Wouldn't run. Wouldn't feel. The fear of death is the pulse of life and believing death is real gives emotion to the experience. It, in other words, feeds The Entity.

He doesn't recognize the streets he's speeding down, only has a vague idea of the direction. Yun remains on his tail. She doesn't know when to quit.

    WITHERING HARVEST
    When the <b>5</b> generators have been repaired, the exit gates power up and become accessible. Their positions will be temporarily revealed to the Survivors. To open the gate, its switch must be held down for a few seconds. This is a crucial movement, as Survivors are exposed and vulnerable during this time. There's a good chance the Killer will head straight for one of the exits as soon as they become powered.<br><br>Once the gate is opened, Survivors can go through and escape. Survivors may also choose to stay in the trial and help other Survivors escape, but the <b>Endgame Collapse</b> will require they leave before the timer expires, or else The Entity will take them forcefully. Taking the risk of staying for others in need is a great way to earn more Bloodpoints and a good reputation.

    Summoning Stone Block
    Sally marches down the hall to the source of the scream. Patients, each in their own rooms, react, an interlude of cries and shrieks joining in, accompanied by the thumping of a head slamming into a wall. The volume builds, louder and more chaotic, until finally, as if reaching a crescendo, a patient howls. Sally rushes into a room, moving towards a hideously scarred woman, restrained to the bed, whose scream slowly dies into soft, mirthful laughter. Did you enjoy the song, sweet nurse? I call it Concerto of Lunatics.<br><br>The asylum is wide awake now, alive, anxious, the scattered shrieks and moans of patients ricocheting through the halls. Sally's chest tightens, as she struggles to breathe. Why... why must you rile them? The Broken Woman smiles beneath the swath of bandages over her scarred face. Through two small holes, mismatched eyes—blue and orange—sparkle. Oh, sweet nurse, what are the jesters for if not a laugh? Sally knows to step away, knows there is nothing to gain from arguing, yet she cannot restrain herself. They are humans and, sick as they may be, they deserve sympathy. This is a line Sally has told herself many times over the years, though that is all it has become—a line; a series of carefully rehearsed words pushed through chapped lips. Perhaps this is why the Broken Woman chuckles as if trading quips with a friend. They deserve sympathy? Most have contributed nothing but pain, and the others have contributed nothing at all.

    <b>Stories from the Witch Café. The Bell from Hell.</b> Welcome one, welcome all, to the only place in town to get a story and a coffee. I can tell you where the coffee comes from, but please don't ask me where the stories and characters come from cause I basically have no clue. Some say it's the aroma of freshly brewed coffee that inspires me. Others say I'm able to tap into the endless memory streams pouring out of the infinite kettle that is the multiverse. I think it's a little bit of both. This one comes from the grains I observed at the bottom of my espresso cup a few days ago. It kind of resembled a bell… and so I'm calling this one… The Bell from Hell. <br><br>Toby and his sister Tina were always up to no good, and this time they snuck into the old, overgrown junkyard that many claimed was haunted. Despite the rumors, the teens played in the rusty wrecks, honking horns, kicking windshields, and, of course, scaring each other to hell. <br><br>'It's fun here!'' Toby said. <br><br>'It is!'' Tina agreed. <br><br>As the night wore on Toby hid in the trunk of an old sedan with the intention of scaring his sister. But Tina followed a trail he unwittingly left and— <br><br>RRRAAH! <br><br>Scared him instead! <br><br>Toby cursed, and Tina ran off promising she would get him, again. She quickly rushed to the old compactor and hid in a half-squashed station wagon filled with a strange, black fog. That's odd, she thought, and didn't think any more of it. <br><br>But she probably should have thought a little more of it since strange, black fog isn't exactly an omen as you know from my previous stories.  Anyhow, Tina waited patiently in the backseat. When an hour passed, she began to worry. Slowly, she craned her head to peak out the window when—<br><br>RRRAAH! <br><br>Toby slammed the station! <br><br>Tina nearly jumped out of her skin, hitting her head against the ceiling of the half-crumpled car. Toby couldn't help but laugh, and as he laughed, he looked down into the churning, black fog and saw—<br><br>A bell. <br><br>A strange-looking, iron bell unlike any bell he had ever seen before. <br><br>''Will you look at this, '' he said, holding up the bell, examining the craftsmanship. Then he grabbed a stick from the ground and clanged the bell stupidly. <br><br>CLANG. CLANG. CLANG. <br><br>The ominous ring echoed through the abandoned junkyard as the black fog thickened and swirled around them. But before they could say anything about the strange fog—<br><br>The compactor came to life! <br><br>WHIRRRRRR! <br><br>Tina felt her heart fall into the pit of her stomach, and she screamed in horror! <br><br>Toby dropped the bell, grabbed her hands and yanked her out just in time. Breathlessly, they watched the station wagon as it creaked and groaned and shattered into scrap. <br><br>There was a long, tense silence as they wondered what had given sudden power to the otherwise rusted and broken compactor. Just then, the bell rang, again. This time behind them. Tina exchanged a look with Toby and swallowed a growing thickness in her throat. They turned slowly to face—<br><br>Nothing. <br><br>Absolutely, nothing. <br><br>Nothing but the swirling fog. <br><br>It was probably just their imaginations. <br><br>Or was it... <br><br>For just as they released a collective sigh, the bell rang once again, and something suddenly materialized out of the fog. Within moments, they were face to face with a—<br><br>Wraith! <br><br>The Wraith instantly grabbed Toby by the neck with one arm and lifted him high in the silvery moonlight, his feet dangling, his arms flailing, his lips quivering with fear. <br><br>Tina gasped and stumbled back to her haunches. The Wraith smashed Toby against the ground with a powerful thud. He raised a rusted, wheel wrench and proceeded to bludgeon his head to scrap, blood and gore splattering everywhere. <br><br>Then the Wraith turned to face Tina with his creepy bell and dead eyes. Covered in her brother's warm blood, Tina screamed until her lungs gave out and waited... for the bell to toll. <br><br>Now what the siblings didn't realize was that they had entered a kind of dimensional pocket that had brought them to another world.  See, there are these pockets or holes in the world that lead to all kinds of dark places… places that defy reality… dark places that make all our combined depictions of hell seem like a flower garden.  But that's another story for another dark and creepy night. Let's just say that for Toby and Tina death was not an escape.

    Enter the Killer Shack.
    Last rehearsal before opening night and she’s nailed her role despite some last-minute changes to the script. She feels the adrenalin and a great sense of flow unlike anything she’s ever experienced before.  The director claps after the last line is delivered. He approaches her. Tells her he’s amazed. Impressed. Inspired. But… he feels her character would work better with an accent. A what? The request undermines her. Shatters her. Why? I don’t understand. For giggles. It would be fun. The character doesn’t need an accent. The character is fine without an accent. But it would add comic relief. Comic relief? That’s what she is to this director. To the producers. To this industry. Comic relief.<br><br>She stares at him. Waits for him to burst out laughing. Waits for him to say he’s joking. Waits for an apology that never comes. She sighs and feels the strength of her ancestors coursing through her veins. A strength that won’t allow her to sell-out. A strength that won’t allow her to perpetuate a hurtful image of what it means to be an American. She shakes her head at the director. Find a comedian asshole.  She storms off stage. Those who follow their path beat the odds even if the odds are a billion to one.  Bullshit.

A few of your maggot friends sold you out for a few dollars. Evan starts but doesn't say anything. Can't say anything. The words are caught in his throat. He apologizes. His father says nothing.

    Bill leads the ragtags as he calls them through a city he doesn't recognize anymore. It's crazy how fast the flu changed everything. Change. It's the one thing that never surprised him. The one constant in his life. Change and surviving in the new normal. But this new normal… could take some getting used to. Ain't like they're gonna tear each other apart, apologize, then be friends again. He stares into the gloom and goes over the last few hours of his life in his mind. He didn't catch anything. They didn't catch anything and by all accounts they should have. Then it dawns on him… they're immune… they're asymptomatic. Ticking bombs just waiting to spread the flu. I brought the flu to them. Poor bastards. Louis steps up beside Bill. What now, Pops? Bill contorts his face. Don't call me pops. Old Man I don't mind, but not Pops. Bill marches on. I tell you 'what now'…  Now we find a safehouse and get some rest. But not before you punch Francis in the mouth for talking more shit than a sewer. Bill laughs. I'm messing, kid, but I see you getting pissed with all the tie jokes. Don't let him get to you. His way to cope with all this shit. I knew guys like him in Nam. They're just scared to die and distracting themselves by messin' around with others. But what really gets me is he stole my goddamn line. Louis laughs. Bill doesn't find it very funny.  I know, I know… Imitation is the sincerest form of compliment. But that civilian using my line. That just ain't right to me.

I walk by the homes gazing at the residual memories of soldiers killing villagers with swords for no other reason than the thrill of it. I can't make out which era or terra world this realm is from. I search the realm for hints of how one may open an actual doorway back home. Somewhere in these memories and forgotten realms is the answer to my salvation. But… which ones… which ones indeed…

    More luminous energy sent to me by an unknown ally. With this energy I was able to open a small window that allowed me to look into a lost realm where I saw to my great surprise a city with survivors living as though nothing was out of the ordinary. The window eventually closed, and I spent the entire evening imagining how such a thing could be possible or if it was merely an illusion. The same night another surge of energy permitted me to open a doorway into a realm I didn’t much recognize or dare explore. I stared at the scintillating doorway until it faded out of existence. It’s as though the one manifesting these sacred glyphs is trying to help me delve deeper into the mysteries of this dimension or, perhaps, he is suggesting that the answers to my salvation are hidden amongst the countless realms discarded by this Old One since time immemorial.

    NEW YEAR CELEBRATION
    <b>Stories from the Witch Café. Wrath of the Killer Pumpkins.</b> Welcome one, welcome all, to the Moonstone Café!  Tonight, seeing as we just made a batch of Pumpkin Spice Cheesecake to go with our famous Halloween Latte, I thought a story about pumpkins might be fitting. This story was told long ago in a village that once stood very close to where we all stand now, and I call this one, Wrath of the Killer Pumpkins.<br><br>The widow's name was Ulla and more than anything she wanted to win the annual pumpkin festival. Not just for the prize money, but to impress her six-year-old daughter, Rebecca, who loved everything about pumpkins. Their texture. Their shape. Their color. Their smell. Everything.<br><br>But Ulla's pumpkins were nothing compared to her neighbor's pumpkins. Her neighbor Mona won the pumpkin festival every year, and she seemed to have a secret for growing perfect pumpkins. <br><br>That's not to say, Ulla's pumpkins were bad. They weren't. They just weren't very special. At best, they had been described by the great pumpkin judges as average. Average height.  Average width. Average color.  Average smell. Average.  
And average didn't win awards. <br><br>Well, not wanting to be average anymore, Ulla decided she needed to know Mona's secret. So, one morning she waited until Mona left for the market, and when she knew the coast was clear, she did the unthinkable. She snuck into her house. <br><br>To Ulla's amazement the kitchen was filled with glass jars containing pumpkin seeds of every variety. Each jar had a label that included a name, instructions, and some very peculiar symbols.   
Reading the labels, Ulla felt a cold shiver run through her body. She couldn't make sense of the names or symbols and for a moment, just a moment, she suspected witchcraft. <br><br>Part of her wanted to run, but the other part—the part that hated to lose—wanted a little help, a little boost, a fighting chance to win the festival and make her daughter proud. <br><br>Ignoring her better instinct to run, Ulla found a jar labeled: Mortafykuss Cucurruss. She scrutinized the label and read that these seeds would produce the biggest and brightest pumpkins but that they were still quite unstable. The seeds were unstable. Ulla winced, and she had no idea what that meant or how pumpkin seeds could be unstable. She continued to read a warning—<br><br>No blood. Especially at night. <br><br>She laughed out loud. Who in their right mind would feed a plant blood? Who would heed such a warning? And for a moment she really thought that maybe, just maybe, Mona was a witch, a powerful witch who could defy nature and modify and mutate seeds. <br><br>Despite the creepy warnings, Ulla borrowed one seed--just one-- from the Mortafykuss Cucurruss jar, convincing herself that she would give Mona back a seed from her winning pumpkin. With that promise, she convinced herself she wasn't stealing, and she quickly returned to her small, humble farm. <br><br>No sooner did Ulla return home than she planted the seed in her garden. To her amazement there was a visible pumpkin growing the very next day, and every day after that more pumpkins appeared linked to a thorny, green vine unlike anything she had ever seen before. <br><br>Well, to be sure, Rebecca jumped up and down with joy at the sight of the massive pumpkins. She couldn't stop hugging and measuring and sniffing the pumpkins. <br><br>When the time came, Ulla told Rebecca to choose a pumpkin for the festival, and as she selected the choicest pumpkin from the patch, she got so excited that she tumbled into the thick, green vines and cut herself against the thorns. The vines and pumpkins trembled momentarily with sudden life. <br><br>Ulla dismissed the sudden movement as the wind and proceeded to dress her daughter's wounds. Then she placed the chosen pumpkin on a wheelbarrow and pushed it to the market to face the judges of the great, big pumpkin festival. <br><br>It didn't take long to declare Ulla the winner. And Rebecca jumped up and down, and she screamed and celebrated that they had finally won the festival. <br><br>Ulla reveled in her daughter's joy and felt a great surge of pride. <br><br>But that joy was short-lived when Mona suddenly emerged from the crowd admiring the winning pumpkin and sniffing it as though searching for a signature scent. A tell-tale. Proof that Ulla had stolen one of her seeds. Then she put her ear to the pumpkin and locked eyes with Ulla. For a moment, it seemed as though she wanted to say something. But then, Mona smiled, gave the pumpkin a gentle caress, and walked away. <br><br>Ulla watched Mona until she disappeared, and she told herself she would gut her winning pumpkin and return a seed back to Mona just as soon as she returned home. <br><br>And so, with exhausted arms, Ulla wheelbarrowed her pumpkin down the dirt road with her daughter singing and skipping behind her in the moonlight. Caught up in the euphoria of winning, Ulla tried to skip with her daughter, but she missed a beat and twisted her foot on a stone. <br><br>Ulla stumbled forward, lost control of the wheelbarrow and the great, big pumpkin tumbled out, smashing against a massive stone. <br><br>Suddenly, mother and daughter froze in terror! <br><br>Thick, orange liquid like blood poured out of the busted pumpkin. Through the cracks they could see something moving... something... breathing... <br><br>Ulla approached the pumpkin slowly. She hesitated, then placed her fingers in the pulpy crack and pulled and pulled and—<br><br>WHAAAAH! <br><br>A pumpkin baby burst out! <br><br>And attached itself to her face! <br><br>Pulp dripping down her face and back, Ulla ripped the pumpkin baby off her face and smashed it repeatedly against the ground as it wailed and screamed and finally died. Then she dropped the limp, pulpy corpse in the grass and watched it melt into a thick, orange puddle of steaming, pumpkin puss. <br><br>Ulla grabbed her daughter by the hand and rushed home. But when they reached home… the whole farm had been overrun by gigantic, bright orange pumpkins and thick vines with thorns like knives. <br><br>Wanting to burn the pumpkin patch down, Ulla held her daughter close, and she led her to the shed as the vines trembled, slithered and brushed by their feet. Then, all at once, the vines coiled around their ankles and—<br><br>WHAAAAP! <br><br>Mother and daughter hit the ground as throbbing vines wrapped around them like hungry snakes. <br><br>Ulla stared in horror as massive pumpkins seemed to suddenly hatch like giant orange eggs in the moonlight. From those pumpkins came creatures staggering on two legs with long, clumsy vines for arms. <br><br>And as these killer pumpkins closed in on Ulla, she noticed they had orange and green skin and thick thorns for feet, and... the faces… they... resembled... her daughter. <br><br>Before she could make sense of what she was seeing, an evil vine coiled around her neck and head and thirsty thorns pierced her skin and gorged on her blood as hundreds of newborn pumpkin monsters wailed at the moon and a cold darkness swept over her. <br><br>As for the younglings… they grew and multiplied and went on a murderous rampage throughout the town. But, rest assured, they were finally stopped by a few good witches with some pretty powerful spells. But that's another story for another dark and creepy night. Let's just agree that we shouldn't mess around with pumpkin seeds and that we prefer to eat our pumpkins than be eaten by them.

After dealing The Nemesis a few blows, Jill rushed to the basement and picked the lock of a cold room. Once inside, her body turned numb as a black fog engulfed her.

    There was something suspicious nagging him. He couldn't focus on anything else, not even taking a well-deserved break during holidays; he had to investigate the matter further.
    Adapt & Overcome 
    A large, foldable straight razor, used for more than just providing close shaves.
    Boy creeps up behind two deputies he can barely make out in the moonlight. He slowly raises a pointy branch, leaps out, knocks one head and thrusts the branch through the mouth of the other before he can yell for help.  He stares down at the blood gushing out like a geyser. Reminds him of a scene in a cowboy movie. He approaches the other deputy. The deputy turns and grabs Boy. They roll over the crunching leaves and fallen branches exchanging blows. Boy manages to wrap his arm around his neck and squeezes. Legs thrash wildly here and there. Boy squeezes until they stop at once. He hears Chief calling back his deputies. He tells them to come back. Says the dogs have arrived. Boy retreats into the bramble and shadows. He closes his eyes imagines a different life for himself.  He's the Beaver boy, sitting at a table, eating a wholesome meal with his Pa and Ma and they're asking about his day. Then everything changes when he speaks. The sounds upset his Ma. She beats him across the head, holds him down and pours hot sauce down his throat and tells him to never speak again. His Pa grabs him and gives him a lashing with his belt. His eyes spring open. Everything could have been so different had he not been born a monster. Born a monster? Monsters aren't born. They're made. Made in a crucible of hate, cruelty and abuse. Hot sauce and belts! That's the stuff of monsters.
    When he emerged, he carried the prototype of a pressure-based spear gun.

    Those who profit from murder are worse than animals. He can’t get the idea out of his head that people would do such dreadful things for money. If he survives this… if he escapes this scorching hell… he’ll have his revenge. He can’t help but share his dark thoughts with Funanya who says that an eye for an eye is not the way. That an eye for an eye would make the whole world go blind and plunge us all into infinite night. The world go blind? The world is already blind to what is happening to him and his people. To hell with the world. The world doesn’t care. All this unrest and destruction was meant to happen. It was a mathematical formula to divide and conquer and rob his country of its beloved resources. He heard the elders say this a hundred times. Funanya gives him more wise words from dead leaders and he stops talking about revenge. For a moment he thinks that maybe she’s right. Maybe revenge is not the solution. Maybe the world will one day wake up from its slumbering indifference and help his people.

    The ultimate goal of the Killer is to sacrifice Survivors to The Entity. Once a Survivor is hung on a sacrificial hook, the sacrifice sequence will begin. It has 3 phases.<br><br><b>Phase 1: Summoning Phase</b><br>In this phase, The Entity is being summoned to the hook and takes some time to manifest. Hooked Survivors can be rescued or attempt to free themselves from the hook. These attempts have a 4% chance of success, and failure accelerates the summoning process.<br><br><b>Phase 2: Struggle Phase</b><br> Once The Entity has manifested itself around the hook, Survivors can no longer attempt to free themselves. They can only struggle to survive. They may still be rescued by other Survivors.<br><br><b>Phase 3: Sacrifice Phase</b><br>The Entity will eventually overpower a hooked Survivor and devour them. The hook itself is destroyed at the end of the sacrifice sequence.<br><br>A Survivor who is rescued or escapes from the hook will progress to the next phase the next time they are hooked. For example, a Survivor who was freed in the summoning phase will progress immediately to the struggle phase the next time they are hooked. A Survivor who was freed during the the struggle phase and hooked again will be immediately sacrificed.<br><br>A Killer who sacrifices all 4 Survivors in the trial will earn The Entity's favor.

    Grandmother Abigail hasn’t smiled for days. A terrible smell of rotting flesh drifts into their village and she tells Philip it’s the stench of decomposing cows. Philip nods, but knows she’s just trying to protect him from the truth. He heard the elders talking by the well. So many dead and... they are burning the bodies before there is an investigation. Who is burning the bodies? Killing crews… Human butchers. Men paid to make his people disappear as though they were an infestation of cockroaches. A deal with the devil for money. He hates them all and tries to sleep but can’t. All he can do is stare at the door where he hopes against hope to see his parents again. But he knows… they’re never returning and all he has left is Grandmother Abi.  

Abi approaches him and lies beside him. He leans his head against her and closes his eyes and cries. He hears her open her mouth to say something... but no words come out. He opens his eyes and she’s crying silently. Before he can say anything, a bell rings, her face grows hard as she grabs him by the wrist and leads him outside to a hatch. A moment later they’re underground with the muted sounds of slaughter vibrating through the ground. He squirms in Abi’s embrace. She holds him tighter and tighter as cries and shrieks swell into an unbearable pandemonium. He never realized humans could emit such sounds and it’s all he can do not to scream himself. He squirms and Abi covers his mouth just in case.

    105.7 FM. Falls City Radio Classics. The spokesperson for the Falls City General Hospital reports an unusual and alarming increase of poison cases due to an unknown spider the size of a fist with bright orange spiral-like markings on its back. The authorities are calling it the hell-back spider and advise you to stay at least two meters away from the spider should you come in contact with one. Federal officials say they are trying to cope with this situation and are still trying to determine if this is in fact a terrorist attack or another phenomenon known as ‘Spontaneous Evolution’ in which new species suddenly appear without any plausible scientific explanation. Other theories suggest a government experiment gone wrong as in the case of the weaponized ticks carrying the human-made Lyme disease variant that escaped from a classified biological warfare laboratory on Apricot Island. The situation seems to be reaching emergency proportions as more and more districts lose power. The city’s coroner’s office says dozens of corpses now reveal the poison from the hell-back spider to be slow and lethal as boils and puss slowly cover the body. There also seem to be indications that some victims go on murderous rampages induced by fever, overactive adrenal glands and what can only be described as a complete loss of sanity. Infected individuals are to be handled with extreme caution until the boils cover the entire body and movement becomes practically impossible. A representative of the Falls City Power Company says they are actively trying to fix the generators to restore electricity but a strange black fog is slowing down repair crews. Anonymous workers at the company are saying on social media that they are hearing strange sounds coming from the fog and believe it may somehow be linked to the spiders. One report claims a worker’s body burst open with spiders after she inhaled the fog. Another report says that before the initial attacks, carcasses of deer were found with thousands if not millions of spiders crawling out of them. I should repeat that… There is a fog and it seems to be carrying microscopic eggs that require a biological host… We advise people to stay calm and take extreme caution if they come in contact with the fog or a hell-back spider. We’ll get back to you with further developments. In the meantime back to Money-Bake brought to you by The Now-or-Never Management Firm… because today’s tragedy is tomorrow’s golden opportunity.

    For decades, Azarov’s Gas Heaven offered the last chance for travellers to rest and fuel up before the long, hard haul through the backcountry. Wiser travellers learned to decline that offer. The phones never worked and people had a peculiar habit of going missing. When the highway came through, bypassing Gas Heaven entirely, business dried up and the gas station was abandoned. No one quite knows how many bodies are stashed out there, or what else is hidden in the ruins of the old rest stop.

    Yun-Jin looks out from her hotel room. Outside the downpour is relentless, causing flash floods in parts of the city. She calls her staff. No matter how bad the storm is, the show must go on. <br><br>Yet the weather is not to blame for the growing apprehension in the pit of her stomach. There is something off about the Trickster, a hunch she can no longer ignore, no matter how profitable he is. While he might seem sincere, years in the business have taught her that she cannot trust anyone.  <br><br> Yun-Jin grabs her phone and activates the GPS tracker on the Trickster's company phone. His location appears as a blue dot on the huge map of Rio. Her gut feeling is right. He is no longer on the hotel premises. <br><br>The chase is on. Time to teach the Trickster a new trick. <br><br>Yun-Jin slows down near Trickster's location. As she approaches, a grey sedan suddenly speeds off. She checks her phone. The blue dot is getting farther away on the map. Trickster must be in the car that just took off. <br><br>Yun-Jin stomps on the accelerator and speeds off. After a few turns she catches up with the sedan, which makes a sharp right. Yun-Jin follows, yanking the steering wheel while stomping on the breaks. Her car drifts into the turn, gliding towards a wretched, narrow alley. <br><br>The sedan accelerates and swerves left, entering a narrow street. Yun-Jin repeats her maneuver and drifts left, but the wheels hydroplane on the puddled asphalt, and the car spirals out of control. <br><br>A thundering crash. Yun-Jin's head is propelled onto the steering wheel. A flash of white light. Then a burning pain follows, coursing down her body from her neck to her lower back. <br><br><b>***</b><br><br> Yun-Jin coughs and gasps at the pain. For a moment, all she can do is breathe. When she exhales, the pain lessens slightly. Loud rock is blaring on the radio. It’s so loud. She reaches forward and turns it off absentmindedly. A spot above her left brow is burning. She touches her forehead softly and winces. A drop of blood drips down her finger.<br><br>The windshield is cracked on the passenger side. Yun-Jin moves slowly, carefully leaning over. <br><br>It's OK. Everything is OK. I'm OK. <br><br>She looks out. The car crashed into a streetlamp on the passenger side. This could have been much worse. <br><br>A familiar ding interrupts her thoughts. Her phone. Yun-Jin slowly leans forward, her hand searching under her seat. She grabs her phone and unlocks the screen. A text message from the Trickster: HELP.<br><br>Why would he ask for her help… unless she missed something? Unless… the Trickster is not the one she is chasing. <br><br>Yun-Jin's heart skips a beat. The death threat. The Trickster's number one fan. Perhaps the crazed fan found out about the Trickster's nightly escapades and decided to strike. Kidnappings go hand-in-hand with death threats after all. <br><br>She lets out a curse. In her rush to chase the Trickster, she left her bodyguard behind. If anything happens to the Trickster, Ji-Woon, and she was too blind to stop it… No. She has enough guilt on her conscience already. <br><br>Yun-Jin re-adjusts her seatbelt. She turns on the ignition and the engine coughs in response. She grits her teeth and tries again. <br><br>It won't be like the fire… I won't give up on him. <br><br>She turns on the ignition again. And again. On the third try, the engine revs back to life. She puts her phone back on the dashboard and follows the blue dot.

    The Entity is the cosmic embodiment of evil. Back home we witnessed how its very presence turns worlds inside out… how it seems to remove or extinguish any sense of empathy or compassion within communities… how it brings people to the brink of madness and… well… pushes them in. Now I understand it does all this in order to rip victims from their lives and have them play out an endless trial of terror that it presumably needs for its own survival.  And there, perhaps, lies the key to its destruction… if an Ancient can be destroyed at all.<br><br>End the trials. Destroy its ability to sap dark nectar from victims like a cruel parasite feeding from a flower. At least the Archives affords me a better understanding of the Entity… why it moves from universe to universe, picking victims off and devouring worlds as though at a cosmic buffet. What I have yet to conclude is whether it is attracted to worlds that are brimming with darkness and madness or if it is in fact the catalyst of such darkness and madness.

    Jake bites his lower lip with the thought of chowing down on a rack of ribs—smoking, charred, succulent ribs. He shakes his head and returns his focus to the moment… to the wild hog he’s been tracking through the woods all morning and afternoon. But he can’t get the thoughts out of his mind. He’s never had such a hard time keeping his focus. When he’s not thinking about food he’s thinking about the past, about home, about the argument. Seems like it happened so long ago. The argument started on Friday and by Monday morning, he was out on his own, exiled from the only life he knew for disobedience. But it wasn’t disobedience. Not to Jake. To Jake it was a need. No. It was more than a need. It was a longing… a profound longing to know where he came from and why his father never talked about him.  

But you didn’t have to push him so hard, did you?  

I did. I had to. I had to because I had the right to know who he was. Don’t you see? I have an emptiness inside me that no money or thing can fill. Yet… he never told me anything about him… he just distracted himself with the business and all the trappings of a superficial life and—  

Raising you, Jake! Raising his boys!  

Jake stares past trampled grass and he hears his mother’s voice resounding through his head. Jake… please… you are expecting a straight thing, and no straight thing has ever been made. Your father isn’t perfect, and everything he’s done is to give you a better life than he had. He has his reasons.  

And I have mine!  

Jake closes his eyes. He remembers leaving home without saying goodbye. He remembers backpacking across Korea, meeting people who had known his grandfather and could tell him stories about how he had lived. And none of the stories he had been told justified burying the past the way his father had done. He had expected his grandfather to be an abusive, deadbeat and yet... he had discovered a hero... a legend even. He had saved and reunited so many families and so many were grateful and indebted and still… he never mentioned him.  

Maybe he didn’t want a legend, Jake. Maybe he wanted something else. But why does it matter? Why does it matter right now?  

A voice of caution suddenly brings Jake back to the moment. His grandfather’s voice or what he thinks his grandfather would have sounded like. Jake… stop thinking about everything else except what you need to think about. You need to eat before you begin to see things that aren’t there. You’ve been at it all morning and afternoon with that make-shift spear, and if you don’t get the hog you’ll end up like me.  

Jake nods with a slight respectful bow as he examines the freshly trampled grass.

    Chamber of Blood. Harbinger of Hell. Evil Eyes. 3.<br><br>Three men speaking an ancient, unknown language forced Haddie and Jordan through the dark and seemingly endless cave with flickering flashlights to illuminate the way. Somehow these captors knew Haddie had a gift and were barking orders for her in broken English to lead them to the place where the thuggee rebel had hidden the relic. She didn't recognize her captors but it wasn't the first time someone had forced her to find something with her special abilities.  

Haddie followed a trail of residual memories—memories and whispers only she could see and hear. She could sense they were walking through an 'overlap' of realities which heightened and reinforced her abilities in an inexplicable way. She followed the scintillating orange trail and froze when the residual soldiers suddenly disappeared. Then she started when the soldiers blinked back into existence and she heard desperate screams as something she couldn't make out attacked them.   

“What is it?” one of her captors asked.  

“She's seeing something,” Jordan said. “Let her do her thing.”   

“This better not be a trick!”  

Haddie watched the indiscernible creature rip the soldiers into an unrecognizable mess of flesh and gore. The creature then snatched the thug and dragged him screaming through a series of interconnecting tunnels. She chased after the fading memory, entering a small cavern as she watched the thug release the relic as the creature dragged him into a smaller tunnel that she imagined led to a feeding den.   

Memories burned out like dying embers to reveal a cavern of human bones piled over thick rotting sludge. She winced at the stench of fermented organs and fluids and waved a cloud of flies away from her face. Near one pile of bones was a corpse, still warm, flayed from head to toe, eyes missing, mouth transfixed in an agonizing scream. The captors stared at the corpse for a long moment before one prodded Haddie with the barrel of his rifle. 

 “What the hell did this?” One of their captors murmured in disbelief.  

“There must be a bend in reality here.” Another captor offered as an explanation. Haddie noted that what she called an 'overlap' these men called a 'bend.' It was clear that they had an understanding of other dimensions and that somehow this piece of column was more than just a relic. 

“Where is it?” The leader prodded Haddie. “Where's the relic!” 

Haddie took a moment, then pointed at a pile of bones. “But it could also be in there…” She motioned toward the tunnel that led to the feeding den.  

“Check the bones,” one captor ordered the siblings.    

Jordan and Haddie kneeled in the sticky sludge and rummaged through the bones as the leader turned toward the shadowy tunnel.  He inched close to the opening and flashed a blade of light inside. While the other two captors were dealing with flies and covering their noses, Haddie found the jagged piece of column and stealthily slid it over to Jordan.  

A sudden chatter of teeth and hissing made them all turn to the leader. He searched the darkness with a beam of light that suddenly momentary revealed a grotesque creature with a face covered by dozens if not hundreds of glowing red eyes.  

The leader brought the beam back to the face as the creature hissed and revealed a mouth filled with needle-like teeth. An instant later the creature grabbed the flashlight and pulled the leader inside the den.  

The other captors stumbled, dropped things and fired stupidly into the darkness. Haddie instantly grabbed a fallen flashlight, looked at her brother with wide, desperate eyes and yelled for him to— 

“RUN!”

    Talbot wakens in a mass graveyard of skeletons and decaying prisoners of The Company. He blinks and shakes muck from his hollowed eyes. He vomits everything in his guts and doesn't understand what's happening to him. Nothing makes sense except for his hunger. Please… I will… do anything… give me what I ask and I am yours. Give it to me… I need it… Vines suddenly burst through the decaying bodies and surround him. Flowers grow and bloom in all their glory. Beautiful golden serum drips like honey wherever his eye can see. He approaches one slowly and is scared to touch it. He extends his hand and touches the flower and... it doesn't wither away. He touches another. And another. Nothing happens. He goes to grab the flower but instead—the flower grabs him! Vines like tentacles burst out and wrap around him and rip through his veins. Nine hooded figures approach him with disapproving looks. Knowledge without wisdom leads to self-destruction. They inch up to him. Be careful what you wish for, Talbot. Be careful what you wish for.

"Happy anniversary! Here’s to four years of spilling blood together!"
    MEMORY 2483
    A lush green field dotted with salmon-colored lilies and patches of pine trees surround the lake. The colors are more vibrant than Sally remembers, and though it smells of fresh rain, the sky is clear. Andrew sits next to her on a blanket, his blonde hair nearly white in the sun. She wears the dress he had bought her. A symbol of my love, he had written on the card, and for a man of few words it meant many.<br><br>He wipes the grass stains from his calloused hands and turns to Sally. We should get home. The lake will still be here tomorrow. A cold breeze sweeps through the meadow, bringing with it the scent of sweat and dusty linen. She grips his wrist with both hands. Just one more minute, please. One more.<br><br>She hears saws ripping through lumber, the sound heightening with each violent slash. Tighter, she holds Andrew's wrist, pressing her head into his shoulder and bracing herself. An immense tree slams to the ground behind her, sending twigs and dirt into the air. One after another, they come down in booming, ground-shaking jolts. Sally coughs through a cloud of dust, keeping her grip on Andrew the entire time.<br><br>A bead of blood trickles down his arm, coming to rest on her finger. She looks up to see her husband's skull broken open, spilling blood and chunks of brain. One stark white eye looks out from the carnage, focused intently on her. We would have had beautiful babies, Sally.<br><br>She collapses into the crimson muck of his chest and cries. The skin on her hands flakes away, turning to dust. She loses her grip on him. Everything she was, down to the dress she wore, decays, blown away in the wind.<br><br>The sweaty hands of Kavanagh shake her as she awakes on the asylum floor. 
    Her racing style was risky and fast. To limit injuries, she wore a synthetic pair of padded pants that were ideal for abrasion resistance.

    This is not the Badham Preschool where children laughed and learned, made lifelong friendships and had their paintings hung on the walls. This is a dark echo created from the nightmares of those who suffered there. The walls creak under the burden of history. Events that should be long forgotten are recorded forever in the plaster and stone, pervading the building with misery. Only one part of the building is accurately reflected in this darkness. The squalid room where Freddy Krueger lived and worked. The hidden basement area where he committed the heinous acts that appalled a town and condemned him to death. This is a place of the subconscious, of the nightmare brought into hideous reality.

Meet me here at nightfall in a fortnight's time, and we shall escape the clutches of deceit. If you have doubts, I ask you to consult with your gods. My daughter, may their silence be your answer.

Toward the evening, I tinkered with the Auris, and when this proved frustrating, I worked out mathematical equations and theories while talking to myself and engaging in stimulating debate and what I believed to be meaningful discourse. One of the lessons of those on assignment within the boundaries of an Ancient is to keep to a rigorous routine of writing, reading and self-talk to not let the pillars of the intellect crumble under the weight of laziness, alienation and boredom. Thinking and speaking are skills, and like any skill, they can decay and wither away if not practiced regularly.

But then, the unexpected: chaos awakens. His father shouts from the living room with a booming voice. Jeffrey retreats to his closet. He hears his father coming down the hall, each step louder. Hide! He buries himself under a pile of dirty clothes and shuts his eyes. The closet door swings open. The odor of cheap beer floods in as a large hand grabs him, pulls him. Why! Why, you little shit? Branson says you kicked his damn dog. That true? Jeffrey’s too afraid to say the words forming in his head: It's true. I walloped the smelly mutt good. Don’t know why. Just something like a reaction. Don’t get twisted about it, ain’t nothing different I coulda done. His father shoves his finger straight into Jeffrey’s face. Speak up, you damned idiot! You think I want to be stuck with you? The finger. Thick, oddly straight, a knuckle with ridges upon ridges of loose skin, a chipped nail that lends it personality. Your mom would have hated you. You listening? Jeffrey can’t look his father in the eyes. He retreats to his imagination. Hack off his finger, Jeffrey! Make dad cry, make the blood spurt. Point the finger right back in his face and laugh. Laugh, Jeffrey! His father looks ready to burst as his face reddens. This funny to you? You some kind of clown? Keep laughing and see what happens. And though Jeffrey fears his punishment, he can’t get the bloody thoughts out of his head—so he laughs and laughs.<br><br>Jeffrey examines Moustache’s finger as the crowd jostles around the circus tent.

    Ma sobs on the ground with a mouth full of cracked teeth. Boy lifts her with one arm and a flood of inarticulate words rush out of his mouth. Words he only understands. Words the TV taught him. He wants to know his name, his real name, and she just stares at him, confused, lost, desperate. She gurgles blood and chips of tooth slip down the side of her face as she begs for her life. Even if she understood what he was saying she could tell him nothing. My name! My name! What's my name! Boy slams his Ma against the ground again and again. He lifts her over his head and hurtles her against the kitchen table. It breaks under her weight. Blood gushes from a wound in her leg. She loses consciousness. He feels bad and holds his limp body. Why? Why did you hate me? What did I do to make you both hate me so much? Her face is beautiful and hideous at the same time. Evil veiled by beauty. He hugs her, harder and harder, wishing everything would have been different, wishing he were one of those damn pigs. They spoiled them with love, affection and time—all that time they spent Duke and Donny while he groveled nameless and alone in a dungeon built just for him.  
He tries to lift her but slips in a pool of her blood. She struggles in his embrace. Every time he asks the question he squeezes her tighter and tighter. My name… What's my name? Her struggles cease and she jerks spasmodically. Tense arms and legs go limp. He releases her slowly. Her head thumps hard in a puddle of blood. She stares upward with blue vacant eyes. Beautiful blue vacant eyes. Eyes that only saw a monster, a thing, a beast of burden to work the farm.  Never a son. Never her son. He hates those eyes. Those...those... hateful eyes. He rips them out and squeezes. They pop like bovine eyes.  He smiles and doesn't really know why he's smiling. He wipes blood off his face and likes the mushy feeling in his hands. He hears a foot pound the floor behind him. Chief suddenly rushes into the kitchen.  I'm gonna smash your head with your own goddamn hammer! But as he lifts the hammer he slips in an inch of warm blood. Boy panics and rushes outside into the darkening woods with Chief screaming and cursing and bullets whipping by him.

    Despite her traditional upbringing, Yui Kimura raced scooters in her hometown of Hida where she earned the reputation of being able to do the impossible with very little. Her father did his best to steer her away from what he believed to be masculine pursuits, but her grandmother secretly shared her grandfather’s engineer manuals and notes on car and motorcycle engines. Yui read her grandfather’s manuals and learned fast. She was able to not only maintain her scooter, but she modified the engine so that she could compete with older boys on motor crosses. With her grandfathers ‘good luck hachimaki’ wrapped around her arm, she raced local boys who, unable to keep up with her, worked together to orchestrate her defeat. No luck for them. Yui outmaneuvered them at every turn and became a sensation to all her friends.  When it came time to apply for school, Yui gathered her courage and confessed her ambition to race motorcycles to her father. An altercation ensued and when Yui refused to apply for a proper education, her father felt a great shame and told her she was no longer welcome in their home. With a heavy heart, Yui left for Nagoya with the blessings and savings of her grandmother.<br><br>Nagoya was not what Yui expected. She could only find low grade clerical work or minor jobs as a hostess. With the last of the money her grandmother gave her, she purchased a racing bike and entered illegal street races where she won more money than she had ever seen. Rumors of her courage and quick reflexes spread like wildfire. Soon she had an unofficial retinue of women motorcyclists wearing Yui’s signature pink. Along with a gang following her, Yui realized she had a stalker following her in the shadows. When Yui realized her lucky handkerchief had been stolen from her apartment, she took her concerns to the police who laughed and dismissed her, saying her stalker was probably a nice guy and that she would probably marry him in the near future.<br><br>One evening Yui returned home to find the stalker in her apartment going through her things. He hadn’t seen her, and she wasn’t sure what she should do. But the sight of him going through her clothes was too much to bear. She yelled for him to leave.  The stalker turned to her with a knife. He lunged at her.  She evaded his attack, and he hit the wall and dropped his knife. Without hesitation, Yui tackled him. They rolled over the ground exchanging desperate blows. Yui took more blows than she had ever experienced racing scooters in Shirakawa. With a surge of adrenaline, she managed to overpower her stalker, snatching the knife from the floor and holding the razor-sharp blade to his neck.<br><br>When the police reached her apartment, they took him away and rushed Yui to the hospital for trauma. X-rays revealed she had broken her arm and foot in several places. It wasn’t long before her gang showed up one by one and together they helped her pay her medical bills.  Rehabilitation was difficult but Yui never gave up and with the support of her gang she was ready for the races. Yui’s first race after the attack her gang presented her with a new pink hachimaki with their signatures and good luck messages written all over it. Yui vowed she would help other women with her winnings and influence. True to her word, her gang became known as the Sakura 7 Gang and they wore pink hachimakis as a symbol of unity and support for women needing help from stalkers and abusers.<br><br>The Sakura 7 grew beyond the 7 members and Yui’s signature pink became synonymous with women’s empowerment. At street races women would line up in droves to support her. After winning seven straight races in a row, she attracted the attention of a sponsor. She not only earned a spot at the All-Japan Moto Championship but was the youngest woman to race and win in the prestigious event. Her sponsorship soon tripled. So, too, did her gang. But everything came to a staggering halt at the illegal TK3 (Tokyo Kick 3000) street races. Yui was leading the race until she entered an unnatural fog that seemed to have appeared from nowhere. Baffled and confused, she stopped her bike and dismounted. It wasn’t long before she realized she wasn’t in Tokyo anymore.

    Ji-Woon Hak thrived under the attention of others, energized by every eye that watched him and every tongue that spoke his name. Amidst the prestige, he had only one desire: more. Even as a child he found ways to draw crowds. Working at his family’s restaurant, he attracted business with spectacles he performed using throwing knives. Gullible tourists believed this was a traditional South Korean experience, gladly parting with their money to witness it. Ji-Woon's father spent the restaurant’s earnings on dancing and vocal lessons for his son, pushing him to attain the fame he never could.<br><br>Ji-Woon did not disappoint. After years showcasing his abilities to nobodies at talent shows, he hit the track to stardom. Yun-Jin Lee, a producer at Mightee One Entertainment, recruited Ji-Woon into her training program. He transferred to a dormitory in Seoul where, for fourteen hours a day, he was crafted into a star, taught how to move and sing, how to carry himself with the right balance of confidence and modesty.<br><br>Draining as the process was, it worked. Yun-Jin selected Ji-Woon to join the band NO SPIN, bringing a raw energy to their tracks. Fame was almost immediate. Ji-Woon lived in a daze of interviews and adoration, and though the frenzied schedule exhausted his bandmates, he was invigorated. Each day was an affirmation that he was greater than the mediocrity society spewed out.<br><br>But over time, the champagne grew stale. When he looked at his fans, he saw their joy and envy split five ways, thinned out between each band member. The validation that had surged through him left a desperate yearning for more.<br><br>Ji-Woon kept up impressions, mimicking a charm long buried under loathing. He recorded the latest NO SPIN album with his bandmates, never missing a beat. After a lengthy lunch break, he returned to the studio to discover fate had granted him a gift. The scent of burning wires was unmistakable. He rushed to the control room, finding the door blocked by fallen speakers. On the other side, his bandmates pounded on the door, their cries accompanied by the crackling of flames.<br><br>Ji-Woon called to them, dashing to the speakers, grabbing one and—stopping. He froze. Each breath was a conscious, deliberate process requiring all his attention, the nearby cries hardly audible until, slowly, he backed away. And then he heard it. They were screaming his name as they burnt. Screaming for him to save them. Ji-Woon! Ji-Woon! Ji-Woon Hak! It was the most beautiful thing he’d ever heard. When the fire crew arrived, his tears were genuine.<br><br>Ji-Woon was celebrated as a tragic figure, a hero who did all he could in a futile attempt to save his friends. Yun-Jin paraded him through interviews until it was time to rebrand. He was reborn as The Trickster, a solo artist who produced his own songs, sporting a soft heart beneath a wild exterior. But, away from concert set-ups and television stages, something darker grew.<br><br>He targeted those who lived alone, coming to them in the night. The first was a college music student with a captivating voice. Ji-Woon woke him with a baseball bat to the skull, binding his arms and legs, gagging him with a rag duct taped into his mouth. He tortured him for hours, dissecting him alive. Yet there was something missing—a sound, a connection. He wanted to hear the victim’s wonderous voice pleading as he cut his belly open, but all he received was muffled cries through a rag.<br><br>He learned and adjusted.<br><br>Victims had to be abducted, driven to an abandoned building where he could let their voices carry unrestrained emotion. He made music from them, prodding in the right places to evoke different types of shrieks and howls. Stabbing the quadratus lumborum elicited a long, guttural wail, while slashing the carotid artery created a sound similar to a cat being strangled. There was honesty in their suffering. Ji-Woon recorded each session, synthesizing and working them into his songs, hiding them behind layers of melodies.<br><br>He was elated with his work. He left hints for police, arranging a mink boa from a recent photoshoot around a victim’s slashed throat. For his next killing, he removed the teeth from a man that a boxer in one of his music videos was without. During a particularly audacious plea for attention, he killed a fan he had met during a VIP meet-up, replacing her eyes with his diamond cufflinks and writing I HAVE SEEN GOD in blood across her chest. Each scene was a dazzling spectacle.<br><br>Between music and murder, Ji-Woon’s work was discussed globally. However, as violence became his preferred art style, his music career took a hit. Revenue was down and Mightee One executives pointed their fingers at him. Yun-Jin, with professional fury, came to his defense, but she was outnumbered. It was decided that Ji-Woon could no longer self-produce his songs.<br><br>The decision was devastating. His tracks fused genuine humanity into music, yet executives rejected anything that wasn’t generic and expected. And so be it. If they couldn’t understand his art, he would incorporate them into it until they did. 

He had three months until he was to perform a private show for Mightee One’s board members; three months to plan his magnum opus. He transferred obscene amounts of money to a veterinarian in exchange for cannisters of nitrous oxide, then bribed the stage technician of Mightee One’s private theatre for access to the room. His celebrity granted him a benefit of the doubt no regular person could conceive. When the show was ready, gas seeped into the room as executives and stagehands awaited Ji-Woon, conveniently running behind schedule. 

When he arrived, half-conscious bodies were splayed in their seats and crawling across the floor. He worked quickly, binding everyone, pausing only when he came to Yun-Jin—the woman who had plucked him from a mudhole and set him on the path he deserved. She would be rewarded, granted special access to the coming display of wonder. Even under sedation, she fought, a raging storm within her, far stronger than the others. He propped her up as the lone audience member, prying her eyes open. The others, sniveling and sobbing, were brought on stage to perform their final act. With a contemptable sneer, he slapped makeup onto their faces and shone stage lights upon them. They became his instruments. 

To the sound of self-produced melodies, he tortured them, gracefully dashing from one body to another, conducting an operatic crescendo from their wailings. They shouted, whimpered, screamed, cried for their loved ones, cried for their mothers. It was a magnificent outpouring of emotion, of what it meant to be human, and they did it with eyes fixed on Ji-Woon. 

Viscera drained from the stage until, with the toss of his throwing knife, the final human instrument fell silent and the music stopped. Covered in sweat and blood, an exhausted Ji-Woon looked to Yun-Jin and bowed. Curtain call. He had attained perfection. With blade in hand, he made his way to Yun-Jin, prepared to tie up loose ends before the credits rolled. But as he reached her— 

The Fog. 

From where, he didn’t know, but it billowed around them, damp, cool... comfortable. He saw the grand stage: hospitals and temples, forests and slaughterhouses—an eternal plane adorned with rusted hooks, sustained by the million eyes that would watch him, run from him, <i>experience him</i>. All he had to do was accept, become an implement of The Fog and, most importantly, make them scream.

Twenty years later The Narrows dies a slow, agonizing death and there's no justice and there probably never will be. There isn't even an investigation or a hospital or a center to treat the poisoned. The environmental agency says everything's fine, but it isn't. It really isn't. No one wants to say its mercury poisoning. To admit to mercury poisoning is to admit fault.  To admit fault is to help The Narrows and pay for a cleanup. The city doesn't want a lawsuit. No one is moving or doing anything and yet children are suffering and dying. Children are suffering and dying… and no one is doing anything... and Nea can't stop thinking about them. Takes a special kind of evil to poison children.  Something about the whole thing makes her want to get involved, real involved, like her friend Casey. Maybe she should tag those so-called public servants who only serve themselves.

    An exclusive shirt for the Brazil Comic Con.
    In the vast desert of rubble and crumbling columns he sees a flower, a single flower. He shambles through the ruins and extends his hand into a blurring image. Stem and petals disintegrate before his touch. An illusion…  He looks up and there... another flower. He rushes toward it as the ground beneath his feet shatters. Endlessly he falls through the remnants of lost and forgotten realms. He wants it to stop. He can't take the rush of hot air and the feeling of his organs rising into his mouth. He hits the ground. Ribs jut out of his chest. Jagged bones rip through his fetid skin. Where am I? What is this place? He's in a half-remembered laboratory. He sees an emblem. The Company. He remembers the wars. The Opium Wars. He remembers the prisoners and the experiments and his endless search for doorways into other realms. He found them, just not the way he thought he would. Warm blood pools around him as thousands of decaying prisoners in company fatigues grab and claw at him. This isn't happening. It can't be happening. You're dead! You're all dead! He closes his eyes. A collective roar and the prisoners lift him over their heads and toss his broken body into a lightless dungeon. Dark. Cold. Lonely.

    The Russian soldier does a peculiar thing to his prisoner. He ties him to a gnarled branch by his ankle and lights a fire a few inches under him. She scrunches her brow. Confused. You kill the game before you roast it. But these soldiers enjoy his agony. She recognizes the yelling and shrieking foreigner. Just a few moons ago he was torturing Russian prisoners in another tent. Just a few moons ago he was the tormentor. The Russian holds the perfect gift in his hands while the prisoner shrieks and squeals like a pig. She smirks. It's kind of a funny cry. It is. It's amusing. The Russians make jokes and imitate the squealing cry. She fights down explosive laughter. It's the most ridiculous sound she's ever heard. The sound of an approaching soldier suddenly startles her. She wheels to see a glittering bayonet rushing her. She evades and grabs the pathetic, scrawny man by the neck, curls her callused fingers around his bulging apple and yanks with devastating fury. With a choked gurgle he collapses and lies dead on the ground with his throat torn out. She returns her attention to the laughing Russians and the squealing human swine. She smiles. They'll all be making similar sounds when she's through with them.

    Leader of the Pack
    Misato studies Yui closely. To dream of fog and darkness means you see yourself as an imposter… perhaps even a failure. Yui nods and absorbs her friend's interpretation. Misato sips her beer. To see light means you'll overcome whatever is holding you back. To dream of a crash or a dead end could mean the death of something you want… something you wish for. Yui sighs and doesn't know if she wants to hear all this. The demon? The Oni? Why was it chasing me? Misato nods. The Oni could mean you're struggling to maintain your humanity as you chase your dreams, that you may be torn between right and wrong, between good and evil. Misato laughs to herself as she finishes her beer.  Maybe winning isn' t everything. Maybe you're greedy. Maybe you're trying to swallow an ocean when a glass of water would suffice. Yui scoffs. Greedy? I'm broke and you're paying for the beers! Misato shakes a drunken finger at her. Greed isn't just about money, Yui. It's about wanting more of anything.  More races. More trophies. More fame. Maybe your need to prove yourself is killing something in you that doesn't want to die. Yui sighs and downs her beer. Enough stupid talk and more drinking. Behind her dismissive smile Yui believes her nightmare has nothing to do with ego or greed, but the anxiety of not having the money to pursue her dream.

    Cut Thru U Performance
    Rin sits at her desk dreading the end of the school day. Not because she enjoys junior high or because she respects her teachers, but because she despises being forced to learn kendo. But her father demands it. He demands that she practice the way of the sword. Not just practice. Excel. She's a Yamaoka. The Yamaoka’s come from a proud legacy. A samurai legacy. He reminds her of this every day, and every day the kids tease and humiliate her, telling her she has no business in their class, telling her she should wield a broom not a shinai. She ignores them and tries her best. Maybe if she excels with a katana, her father will feel better. He hasn’t been himself as of late. Frustrated. Irritable. Reactive. She can’t do anything right. Nor can her mother. He has become very quiet and talks and argues with himself. She doesn’t understand what’s happening to him, but she knows he is suffering and the last thing she wants is to add to his pain. Family is everything and maybe one day she’ll be okay with wielding a katana. Maybe she’ll even enjoy it.

    Ace rushes into Uh, Ohs sports bar still pumped with the excitement of the mixed martial art title defense he just watched. Female lightweight MMA champion Mika James knocked the challenger out in the first round and now he’s ready for another thrill. He sits with his buddy Wallace. Did I miss anything? Wallace shakes his head. Nah...They’re preparing the bowl now. Ace laughs out loud. Hilarious. The guy’s going to try to swallow a bowl of slugs. Only at Uh, Ohs would they hold such a ridiculous bet. Wallace nudges Ace and levels a wager. Ten to one he pukes it out. Ace looks at the idiot and the bowl of living slugs in front of him. His instincts tell him this guy’s actually going to do it. Ace just cleaned Wallace at the MMA fight and he doesn’t mind taking more of his money. Ace scrutinizes the idiot just to make sure his gut isn’t leading him astray. Most people would puke trying to swallow the first slug. But not this guy. This guy knows what he’s doing. He’s a winning horse. A sure thing. All right… let’s say double our last bet.  

Wallace nods and assures him he’s going to lose. Ace smirks. We’ll see about that. As he stares beyond the idiot preparing to swallow slugs, he’s amazed to see Mika James at the bar in her signature tracksuit. They exchange a look. He points at his fan shirt and extends a thumbs-up for a great title defense, but she looks past him as she nurses a beer. Wallace sees Mika and nudges Ace. She could kick your ass in two licks. Ace scoffs. That’s a bet you would lose, asshole. I’m double her size and strength. Wallace snickers. I say you don’t last ten minutes… nah… you don’t even last five minutes. Wallace is talking shit just to talk shit. Before Ace can respond, a bell sounds and everyone goes silent as the idiot lifts the bowl of thick, moist slugs to his trembling lips. Ace stops breathing, narrows his gaze, pulls out his lucky alligator tooth, holds it in his fist, and just knows he’s got a winner. In a few short minutes he’ll be laughing all the way to the bank.   Come on, idiot...swallow those slugs.

    There is a reprieve this night in the asylum, and Sally does what any sane person would do—she clings to it with all her strength. The weight that sits in her chest melts away, allowing for one starving breath. The scent of sweat and dusty linen is willed from her mind, replaced with memories of tomatoes and fresh soil. Her feet take her down the hall, heels clicking, echoing into an expanse of shadows. She does not allow herself to see the stains on the walls or the fracture in the window's pane. She could draw them from memory but, for this moment, they cease to exist.<br><br>As Sally reaches the end of the hall, she peers into a patient's room, illuminated by a blade of moonlight cutting across the floor. A young girl, sitting atop the bed, flinches at the oncoming shadow. Only as Sally walks into the moonlight does the girl release her grip on a bundle of sheets. Sally offers a sympathetic smile to her... the Anxious Girl. The asylum's file lists her name as Marion but the staff have codes for each patient. The Catatonic Boy, the Sweaty Codger, the Anxious Girl. Everything they are summarized into two words.<br><br>Sally sits on the edge of the bed, braiding the Anxious Girl's dry, brittle hair. Did you visit the community room today? The Anxious Girl hugs her pillow. I stayed here. A light moan carries through the hall, the first indication that peace will soon be broken. Sally does her best to ignore it, weaving one strand of hair over another. Did you know that room has a chair by the window? You can see the robins building a nest in the trees. The Anxious Girl looks to the hallway, her shoulders tensing as she listens to the distant moan. Sally gently rubs the girl's shoulder, wordlessly offering her sympathy. They sit for a short time until a scream carries through the hallway.

    Dwight approaches Rose. She isn't her usually jolly self. Dry tears line her cheek and her eyes are swollen. She tells him Lazar embarrassed her at a meeting when she refused to go along with his jokes at the expense of the sound designer's speech impediment. He humiliated her for not going along with his stuttering impression. Rose sighs and advises Dwight to record all meetings with the Naked Emperor. Not just for legal reasons but for the yearly roast. Dwight raises his eyebrows curiously. Yearly roast? What yearly roast? She tells him about a yearly gathering of ex-employees who get together to laugh at Lazar's stupidities. Dwight tilts his head. He's really confused. In his mind Peak 22 just opened its doors. How long has Peak 22 existed? Rose calculates on her hands. Five years. Dwight can't believe his ears. Five years and Peak 22 has nothing. Rose smirks. Correction. Five years and we almost have Lazar's biography and his theory on creativity.

    Storm clouds overtake the sky as the first drops of rain spatter onto Ji-Woon's sunglasses. He breathes deeply, prepares for what he's played over in his mind. The anticipation nearly brings him to his knees. The joy of the artistic process.<br><br>He strides to the rear door of a cheap 1980's sedan, glances both ways and appraises the few locals walking the street. Certain no one's watching, he jams a straightened coat hanger around the top of the window, pushing it through the other side. His thin fingers work quickly. Prior experience in breaking and entry pays off. He hooks the wire around the door lock and flicks it up. Without missing a beat, he slides inside, closes the door, and flattens himself along the backseat. He takes off his hoodie and sunglasses.<br><br>From his bag he pulls out rope, a blade, a dusty rag, and a bottle of chloroform. He waits. Takes out his earbuds. Listens to a song that's not his own. One he heard long ago.<br><br>He is eight years old. He sits on his father's shoulders, looking over a sea of human bodies. An elaborate stage is ahead, illuminated by colored spotlights. A man in gaudy, audacious clothing stands in front of a microphone. On each side is a guitarist, behind him, a drummer. A crash of sound. Beautiful, rhythmic music. A voice that twists delicately through the melody.<br><br>His father shouts something but he can't hear. Shouts again.<br><br>This is what you'll do. This is where your talent will take you.<br><br>He feels a tingle through his spine, and sees something incredible: everyone enraptured, focused intently on the sound of a single man. The emotion of thousands is guided by his voice. He is seen by all, he is loved, and he is wonderous.<br><br>Ji-Woon never played his flute again. He reveled in sounds that reached global audiences, attracted screaming fans, turned men and women into idols. His childhood fear vanished as he learned to divulge himself through the intricacy and pliability of pop, his inner thoughts riding atop soundwaves, fusing together with other genres—rock, hip hop, jazz, punk. It was the music that could deliver him the explosive fame he deserved, a promise that he would never be upstaged. He was no longer confined to his timid shell; he revealed himself through his mastery of music, poured his heart into sound. He became envied, lusted over, and respected for the hits that spilled from his lungs.<br><br>He takes the earbuds in his hands and smiles. How miraculous that a boy became a god.

    Jake sits on a stone and watches a hawk circle against the golden dusk. He sighs and feels his stomach twist. He needs something… anything… and he regrets not taking the free granola bars from the clerk at the hunting store. He still doesn’t understand what he was trying to prove and to whom he was trying to prove it to. I guess I want to see if I could be like him.  

You’ve brought trail mix and other snacks before. What’s so special this time?  

Jake draws a deep, anxious breath. I don’t know…  

The hawk sails through the darkening sky, then swoops and quickly disappears near the stream. Jake stares after it for a long moment, then decides. He grabs his spear, staggers to his feet and stealthily makes his way toward the shimmering water.  

By a fallen tree he sees the hawk picking at feathers and bones. He inches closer, lifts his spear and launches it. The spear hits the ground, and the hawk rockets to the sky, leaving scraps behind. Scraps… Scraps will do. For now.  

Jake kneels by a sticky clump of flesh and feathers. He smells the pungent odor of heart-pounding red. He touches the sticky innards and the plucked skin and the bones… bones as white as the hog’s grin.  

Jake sighs his frustration and shakes his head. He doesn’t know if hogs display any kind of emotion. But if they can… this hog is definitely smiling. No… Not smiling… Laughing. 

What kind of bird is this, anyway?  

Doesn’t matter. Jake pulls out matches and cooks the guts, preparing a kind of bird-pudding.  

You brought matches but no granola bars?  

I don’t know what I was thinking.  

You’re not him, Jake.  

I know.  

He died out there. 

He disappeared.  

Same thing.  

Not to me.

    Rin emerges from hiding and begins her long walk home. The dragon in her heart admonishes her for hiding. Tells her she is more than her tormentors and should never cower before bullies and abusers. She’s not sure what she should have done or what she should think. Maybe she should have faced them. Maybe she should have confronted them. Maybe she should have beaten them down and torn them limb from limb. Limb from limb? What am I thinking? Where did that come from? Limb from limb? What dark thoughts are these?<br><br>Before she can answer her own question, she hears a voice. She hears…  her tormentors jeering and spewing insults at her. She doesn’t turn around. She doesn’t run. She doesn’t run because she knows what’s coming and she doesn’t care. The dragon within tells her everything’s going to okay. The boys throw garbage at her. Call her Janitor-Yamaoka! Janitor-Yamaoka! Janitor-Yamaoka!  She knows what’s next. She sees it in her mind’s eye like samurai of old. They’ll push her down. Surround her. Punch and kick her. But this time she won’t let the pain defeat her. She won’t let the fear paralyze her. She’ll use the fear and the pain to feed the dragon. Today her bullies will feel teeth and claws… they will feel her wrath… and they will learn… she is a Yamaoka!

    Time to finish this. Kill the bastard. Right now. Jeffrey Hawk makes his move, rounds the corner of his trailer. He squints, sees footprints in the soft ground. Bingo. Crouches low, belly skimming over the dirt. A crowd roars from the circus tent three hundred yards away. He uses the sounds to conceal his movement. Then he sees it: the shadow of his chosen victim. Focus. Bring on the carnival of carnage. He shifts his weight to his back foot and springs.<br><br>I’ll shred y’up good, you sonnuva bitch! He grabs the raccoon, ripping the creature from his trashcan. They tumble. Garbage spills to the ground. Sharp pain and dull discomfort as he rolls through broken glass, cigarette butts, and half-eaten corndogs. This is the last time you invade my trash! The raccoon twists, snaps at air until finding a fat chunk of flesh. Ah, damnit! Jeffrey loses his grip, recovers just in time to grab a bushy tail. He’s on the defensive; swings the animal around, whirling it like a lasso. He loses his grip. The raccoon soars through the air, reaching incredible heights. The squealing, thrashing silhouette of the woodland creature flies over the backdrop of a full moon. Majestic. It arcs downwards and... lands safely in a tree. Blast it all to hell! With a furious hiss, the raccoon scurries into the foliage and disappears. Scram, ya hairball... touch my garbage again and I’ll make a balloon animal outta your intestines. He wipes a smear of blood onto his pants. A blaring of trumpets rings through the night, coming from the circus tent in the distance. The acrobats are taking the stage! He had nearly forgotten his plan. There’s hope for this night yet.

    An elegant vest that went missing from a casino’s storeroom, and somehow found its way to Ace’s closet.
    Popular and arrogant, yet compassionate, Steve Harrington is an unlikely mentor and leader. He often acts as a surrogate big brother to a younger boy named Dustin. He even helped him find his slimy inter-dimensional pet Demogorgon, D’Artagnan.  His reputation as a protector grew and he soon became a sort of ‘babysitter’ for a group of kids in Hawkins with a knack for messing around with strange and dangerous things. His courage is unmatched so that he was even able to fend off a Demogorgon when it threatened his friends. One evening he received a call for assistance from his friend Nancy Wheeler. He drove all the way to the Hawkins National Laboratory to see if she was okay. He searched the area but only found her notebook. Before he realized what was happening the ground opened up and a swirl of black mist filled his eyes. When he awakened he was in a strange place that seemed familiar but unfamiliar at the same time.

    Overbeck's Objective
    This is the story the tour guide told us after showing us around the old Mad Canyon Distillery in Moonlight Bay.  She offered the adults a taste of Ole Bloody, a recipe that had been infamous during prohibition.  While we tasted the bathtub gin, no one spoke as the firewater burned down our throats. The tour guide talked about the abandoned distillery we were walking through, telling us about how the first gang had all but disappeared before the legendary Al Capone got his hands on the operation. She must have told the story often as she spoke fluidly and made gestures and pauses at all the right moments.  

"Ladies and Gentlemen, I'm not one for tall tales but what we know of the disappearance of the Maddy Hatter Gang is very much a vampire story if ever I heard one.  The Maddy Hatter Gang was mostly made up of the Maddock family led by the father Hank who had a thing about collecting hats from the rival gang members he butchered. He must have stolen the wrong hat because that bloodlust came back to haunt him in the fall of 1921 when his gang disappeared with only the youngest of the family left to tell the tale of what had befallen them. And what had befallen them was indeed a great mystery. A mystery people to this day bicker about and dismiss as an urban legend. But I swear it's no legend and all of it is the truth.  

"The twins Candice and Coddy, while returning with some equipment they had picked up in Ontario, drove into the valley and then carried the copper tubing and flasks into the caves where the gang prepared their white lightning. But when they arrived they found nothing but blood. Blood on the floor. Blood on the walls. Blood, if you'll believe it, running through the tubes and coils of the still. At first, they thought it may have been a rival gang. But there was no sign of bullets or bodies or even a struggle—just blood and an uncanny fog that hung low and heavy in the air.   

"The twins instantly resolved to find whoever had done this to their gang and moreover they wanted to give their siblings, cousins and parents a proper burial. So they grabbed a lantern and plunged into the twisting bowels of the mountain, following a trail of blood. They searched deep into the night with no result. Coddy shone the lantern and was just about to tell his sister he was beaten when he heard the crunch of stone in the distance.  He charged ahead, and she chased after him, stumbling over a boulder, hitting her head against the ground and losing consciousness.  

"When Candice roused, she sprang to her feet and rushed toward the flickering lantern light, screaming her brother's name. Through dancing shadow and light, she approached her pale brother sprawled over the ground with two small puncture wounds in his neck. She felt his chest for a pulse and gasped when she realized he was dead. She shuddered, then screamed, and moved by an unknown force, she grabbed the lantern and charged forward. Then, without realizing it, she entered a massive cavern, feeling the ground beneath her feet turn to mush.   

"She shone her lantern around, revealing piles of human skulls amidst thousands of beetles moving through a thick sludge. At her feet, she saw a few beetles devouring a sick bat. She tensed and looked upward to see thousands of bats sleeping. A few beetles scurried over her foot with morsels of rotting flesh and she kicked them away. She swallowed her fear, realizing that if she woke the bats, they would strip her flesh clean in a matter of minutes.  Then she glanced at familiar barrels in the corner by a pile of animal bones. 

"Silently and carefully, she made her way past the bones.  Opening the barrel, she cringed as a horrible stench assaulted her nose. She peered at the dark brew and wasn't sure what she was looking at. Then she realized she was staring at fermenting lumps of flesh in thick, putrid blood. She was in the vampire's lair.  But before she could continue her search, a roar suddenly startled her.  

"Candice turned and found herself staring at a demon with fangs with a swirling black fog rising at its feet. Through the fog, she saw it was wearing her father's hat. She gave a shout of revenge like thunder. The vampire twisted its ugly head in startled disbelief. Fearlessly, Candice threw herself at the vampire. She didn't care what this thing was or where it came from. She just wanted it dead, and she wanted to do her family proud. The vampire meant to kill her by sinking its fangs in her neck. But she felt strong enough to bring down a mountain.  

"And so she jerked and kicked and pushed its snarling face. With a snarl of her own, she bit back at the vampire, tearing pale flesh off its neck with teeth and jaws strong enough to crush rock.  Before the vampire realized what was happening, she gouged its eye with her thumb, ramming it deeper and deeper as it desperately clawed flesh off her arms and face. But she didn't care. She would not be denied, and within moments she felt the delicate brain matter like warm mud and smiled. Then she curled her finger and yanked as hard as she could with a mad laugh.  

"With a shriek, the vampire convulsed violently, then stopped all at once, its jaws frozen in a twisted, agonized howl. Unable to control her growing laughter, she took back her father's hat and stood proudly as open wounds leaked and sputtered blood. Then the fog rolled over the vampire and somehow made it all disappear. The vampire. The bats. The beetles. The blood. Everything.  

"Needless to say, no one believed Candice and she was put into an asylum to shut-up and wither away. But eventually, some rich philanthropist took charge of her, and she was never seen again."  

Everyone was silent. Someone laughed and said, "That's not really a vampire story, is it?"  

The tour guide replied, "Not like we're used to, no. But that's her story and I swear I told it like I heard it." 

Then a young woman, in a concerned voice, added, "I hope that girl ended up all right."

    The Auris was little understood back home, and to be fair I wasn’t given the chance to explain its merits to the council. Had they taken the time to understand they would have realized that though I had no verifiable explanation for how the Auris works… I had theories, and the most reasonable was that the Auris works on the basis of the Trinitarian—the Trinitarian of Creation—a concept long held by our ancestors and forgotten throughout the ages. But the concept isn’t complicated, isn’t witchcraft, isn’t a secret. It simply suggests that it takes two things to create a third. A father and a mother to create a child. An idea and passion to create something new, something real, something lasting and meaningful. A thought and feeling. Therein lies the best theory of the Auris and how it is able to create with auric particles.<br><br>The failing of other pioneers back home is they believed thought alone was enough when in reality it is only half the equation… the other half is emotion, for it is feeling and passion that fuels the fires of creation. The Auris amplifies and manifests and forges something new using the mold of thought and the fires of passion. Or… I’ve been here too long and I’m grasping at theories to pass the time.

    Resilient and ambitious, Yun-Jin was born into a life of hardship finding success in the music industry after years of effort and self-sacrifice.<br><br>As a child Yun-Jin was fascinated by sound, mimicking drums, and hitting keys on the piano. When she turned ten, however, she lost her instruments. Her family was heavily in debt and did not make the payments in time. The creditors took everything they owned, including the house. Yun-Jin held her four-year-old sister tightly as she cried. They moved into a windowless, two-bedroom basement. Since her parents worked day and night to pay their debt, Yun-Jin became her sister's caretaker. Every night she sang until they both fell asleep.<br><br>At seventeen, the renowned record label Mightee One Entertainment came to her high school to audition talent.  She was rejected as an idol trainee but obtained an unpaid internship at the studio. For the following years, she created some of the studio's biggest hits, without any credit or recognition. To get her dues, she emerged in the public eye wearing flamboyant fashion and put soundbites into her songs that looped her artist name, Magnum Opus. Fans began to recognize her songs and she became the producer of NO SPIN, a poorly performing boy band who needed her special touch.<br><br>Dissatisfied with NO SPIN's commercial sound, she sought a rogue element to make the band stand out. Through her contacts in talent shows she found the edgy, raw sound of Ji-Woon Hak. She re-launched NO SPIN with Ji-Woon as its newest member. Within hours their first video was a viral sensation.<br><br>Their success cemented Yun-Jin’s reputation as a shrewd producer. Adorned in high fashion to attend luxurious events, Yun-Jin's harsh, impoverished childhood seemed far behind her. She moved into a penthouse and dined with socialites in skyline restaurants with breathtaking views of Seoul.<br><br>The success of the first album broke records, setting the bar high for NO SPIN's second. As they were recording new tracks, the fire alarm suddenly blared. Concerned for her safety, Yun-Jin hurried to evacuate the building and left the dallying staff behind. Only when she bolted out into the street that she realized NO SPIN was nowhere amongst the coughing crowd. A goliath of flames engulfed the building, slowly tamed by the steady streams of fire hoses.<br><br>All members of NO SPIN perished in the fire except one: Ji-Woon. The album was ruined. The band was over. She would be shelved while Ji-Woon would rot away as an instructor for idol trainees. But she refused to be a victim who watched helplessly as vultures swooped in to take what was hers.<br><br>Unknown to Mightee One Entertainment, she created new tracks to re-launch Ji-Woon's career. She pushed him to tap into his grief and create a song exploring the pangs of sudden loss. The music video showed Ji-Woon saying goodbye to each member of NO SPIN. Yun-Jin cleverly launched the song under Ji-Woon's newly adopted stage name: The Trickster. He would embody both fear and awe like the legendary dokkaebi spirits.<br><br>Ji-Woon's song was a global phenomenon, its universal themes of grief and guilt resonating internationally. Together, Yun-Jin and The Trickster toured the world. Success greeted them on every shore. Yet disturbingly, so did a series of eccentric murders. This connection unsettled Yun-Jin as she noticed that the tour dates coincided with the victims' time of death. She was weary after the loss of NO SPIN and anxious to preserve her artist, so she increased the Trickster's security detail. What if the serial killer was an unhinged fan fixated on the Trickster, inspired by the artist's morbid songs?<br><br>Returning to Seoul, Yun-Jin worked with Ji-Woon on his new material. When she entered the studio at the brink of dawn, she was surprised to see Ji-Woon already there. He seemed exhausted, like he had worked all night. When she listened to his track, she discovered a bizarre intro filled with shrieks and snares. It was too experimental for her taste.<br><br>A week later, another death was reported. The body showed traces of torture and was arranged in the same flamboyant style as previous murders, this time diamond Cufflinks gouged into the victim's eyes. The following day, the victim was on every television channel. A video from the victim's social media showed her squealing, surprised when her boyfriend handed her a heart-shaped, birthday cake. Yun-Jin's stomach churned. That voice. So familiar. And yet, she had never met the victim.<br><br>The next morning, her heart froze when she listened to the Trickster's opening track. The shrieks in his song matched the victim's squeal. Did he sample the victim's birthday video? No, that was impossible: he had recorded this song before the murder was reported. She stared at Ji-Woon on the other side of the booth's glass window. He was NO SPIN's only survivor. Everyone else was dead. Not to mention the eccentric murders that matched his tour dates. Death trails that seemed to converge… to him.<br><br>If he caused… this, no artist would survive the scandal. Yun-Jin's career, no, her life would be over. All she had would be destroyed. A wave of nausea surged over her. Heart racing, she rushed to the restroom. Wild thoughts blazed through her mind as she splashed icy water over her face. There had to be a simpler explanation. Perhaps she was overworked. Or maybe, she did not trust her success. Her mind was fabricating this suspicion because disaster was easier to trust than success. It was all in her head. She returned to the recording booth, eager to put her worries behind her.<br><br>Months later, pressure came from Mightee One Entertainment executives. Revenue was down and they blamed the Trickster since they disapproved the violent themes in his music and the knife tricks he pulled during performances. While Yun-Jin was furious they scapegoated her artist, she agreed that Ji-Woon's sound was too niche to generate profit. She told Ji-Woon she fought them off but was ultimately outnumbered. Because of her initial fury, he believed her to be on his side. They were given three months to create and perform the next hit for Mightee One.<br><br>Months flew by and the time came for Yun-Jin to take a seat at the executives' private show. She was confident about her song but as soon as the music started, she knew something was amiss.<br><br>Dense, foul smoke permeated the room. Yun-Jin coughed and gasped for air. But the more she coughed, the more she inhaled. Her body sank in the chair, her limbs heavy and numb, and her eyes widened as she watched, terrified, a nightmare come to life.<br><br>The Trickster was a whirlwind of blood, slashing, stabbing, and chopping limbs. The executives were carved up like meat. They could not run. They were stuck, like Yun-Jin, paralyzed. A boiling rage swelled in her gut. How could she have denied her instincts? The fire. The murders on tour. It was him. It had always been him. And she had known from the start. Now her career was over, and so was Mightee One. Everyone she had worked with, her colleagues, her friends, dying before her eyes. Everything she had, taken from her once more.<br><br>No, she would not let him. He would pay. He would know her suffering. Suddenly, dark coils of black fog rose from the ground and she was... somewhere else.<br><br>Bright lights flashed and blinded her. A spotlight found her in the darkness. Then a crowd erupted, chanting her name. "Magnum Opus! Magnum Opus!"<br><br>She smiled and welcomed the darkness within.

    Emotion. Passion. Interest. They are the spark, the undefinable force that enables creation. You cannot manifest anything if you are not filled with emotion about it. The Auris was ridiculed because the council lacked understanding. This might be the whiskey ruminating but… art is not created by thought alone but by thought and feeling working in harmony.  Feeling is everything… Feeling is the most important aspect of bringing anything to life. It is the fuel that makes thought and intention reality.

    Adiris splashes water over the altar and scrubs. Red circle, swirling, bright... like the sun the day she was left at the temple door. Stifling heat, painful steps on burning sand. Mother and father... a missing piece in the memory, unfocused, replaced by... Haban. A crowd of imposing high priests, and only he peers warmly. She cries so he lifts her, removes his hood. In the courtyard he lets her touch the statues of the gods—Rishan, keeper of the stars; Ortares, sentry of the desert; Atil-Alara, mother of humanity—deities who would watch over and protect her. Haban becomes teacher. Father. He tells of their religion: formed by exiles who believed other faiths had become corrupted by politics. They brought new insights to the afterlife and unified all gods beneath the great creator, the sea goat.<br><br>She finds guidance in his teachings, meaning in servitude, comfort in knowing suffering is love. She may shudder at connecting compassion to bloody sacrifice, but she works continually to overcome her doubts. Yet, over the years, as her faith grows, Haban changes in a different way. She sees heaviness in his walk. Hears his voice trail off when he reads the sacred texts. While he once stood energized by generous sacrifices to the gods, today he shows anguish.<br><br>What darkness could snuff the desert sun?

She hears his voice and Frank tells her to meet him at the Ormond Majestic Theatre. Why? What's playing? He doesn't answer. She gets in her second-hand sedan and drives through the blinding snowstorm to the Theatre. He graciously opens the door. Helps her out. Joey and Suzy are standing by the theatre holding empty gas containers. Frank hands her a match. Please… Do the honors. She strikes the match. Watches the flame ignite strong then it dwindles in the cold wind. Before it extinguishes, she flicks the burning match at the theatre. A moment later a massive fire erupts in the blinding snow. She stares at Frank. At the fire. At Joey and Susie. And she has this sudden crazy thought that Frank is right. Somehow the world is conspiring in her favor.

    While performing actions such as repairing, healing or sabotaging, Survivors will periodically trigger <b>Skill Checks</b>. A Skill Check is a quick challenge that requires the player to tap a button at the right time. There are three possible outcomes for a Skill Check.<br><br><b>Good Skill Check:</b> The button is pressed when the red line is within the outlined zone known as the "Good Zone". A good Skill Check allows the action to resume without penalty.<br><br><b>Great Skill Check:</b> The button is pressed when the red line is within the filled zone known as the "Great Zone". A great Skill Check allows the action to resume and grants a small bonus towards its progress.<br><br><b>Failed Skill Check:</b> The button is pressed when the red line is outside the good or great zone, or the button is not pressed at all. Failing a Skill Check creates a great deal of noise and penalizes the action's progress. <br><br>Survivors should always be focused and ready for a Skill Check to appear. They will hear an audio cue before a Skill Check is triggered.

    What the hell was I thinking? Ace staggers to his wobbly feet. Oh yeah… I wasn’t! Mika steps toward him. He throws a desperate right. She ducks with a grin. He follows with a left. She sidesteps and he sees black and a few stars fading in and out of existence. What the hell did she hit me with? He doesn’t know. All he knows is he’s on his ass again and his eyelids feel like cement. He forces them open and stares up at the timer. Thirty-Seconds. How can that just be thirty-seconds! Either the timer is rigged or time itself has slowed down to an impossible crawl. Shit! I’m in trouble but I ain’t losing my lucky gator’s tooth! He doesn’t know much right now but he knows Mika’s got him outclassed in every way except guts and luck. Ace stands on wobbly legs and smiles at one of the dozen Mika’s swirling around him. He regards a dozen clocks, narrows his gaze, and calculates. Four more minutes... I can do this...
    NEW YEAR CELEBRATION
    One shack stood apart from the rest of the village. Once the water was drained and the area beneath the base was revealed, the true horror of the swamp's cage was discovered. It was here that the prisoners, if that's what we should call them, were brought. Held in the water, their bodies bloating horrendously, they were plucked, one by one for the family's needs. The stilts that kept the building upright acted as the only bars that awful jail needed.

    Evan looms over his father's bed and watches him sleep. He hates and loves him at the same time. Sometimes he wonders what his life would be like without him. He owes him so much and yet he's miserable and alone. He raises a massive grey stone and holds it there for a long minute that feels like forever. He could be free. Truly free. But he can't. Not like this. He could free himself in other ways. Accidents happen. Hunting accidents. Mining accidents. He could lure him into the bowels of the mine and ignite a stick of dynamite. No way he'd survive. But despite it all, Evan can't do it. His love is bigger than his hate. He owes him too much.

Your name on a ruined wall, or whatever, who cares. Why not stand for something? Say something? All that time and energy just to say you tagged a scary place. Whoopie. Big fuckin deal. Nea scrunches her face. She feels under attack. What's going on with you? Casey shrugs. I don't know... If you'd at least piss off a tyrant, you would have done something with your... your... art... if that's what you want to call it. Nea doesn't say anything. She doesn't know what to say.

    Max has quite an arm. A famer made his way out of a barn and with one well-aimed blow with a spade, his head was severed from his shoulders and two spouts of hot blood burst from his body like geysers. He watched the headless man stagger stupidly and collapse in a growing puddle of steaming blood. I have to admit I’ve gone through this memory more than once. It’s one of my favorites. I find Max disturbingly amusing and the illusion of death fascinating… at a distance.

    When John Kramer, better known as Jigsaw, planned for his son to be born during the Chinese Zodiac’s Year of the Pig, he wanted it to represent fertility and rebirth; a new beginning for him and his wife, and the start of a charmed life for his son. But that plan was shattered on the night that a junkie broke into his wife’s clinic, hoping to score. <br><br>After this event resulted in the death of his unborn son, John finally caught up with the junkie, making him his first test subject, and the Pig was changed forever too. It became a representation of the disease that was rotting John from the inside, a reminder that we are just meat unless we elevate ourselves through our actions, by grasping life from the jaws of death.<br><br>The Pig became a vessel, an agent of Jigsaw, conveying the subjects to their test. For some of those who emerged victorious, the Pig could still be a rebirth, into their new lives as apprentices, even disciples, of Jigsaw. <br><br>That was the case for Amanda Young, a troubled soul, whose life had been a catalogue of harm, both to herself and those around her. That changed when she faced, and bested, Jigsaw’s test. Deciding her life was worth something, she became devoted to Jigsaw’s cause, ready to take over when the cancer consumed him.<br><br>But she became more dependent on John, her anguish at his impending death combining with a belief that their test subjects weren’t capable of saving themselves, of being reborn in the crucible of the games. <br><br>Seeing this, John presented her with another game, another chance to save herself, but Amanda let her rage and jealousy rule her actions. She failed the test and took a bullet as a consequence. <br><br>Bleeding out on the tiled floor, darkness engulfed Amanda’s vision, accompanied by a sound like creaking wood. Then she was in a forest, once more viewing the world through the eyes of a Pig. Trees surrounded her, their branches clawing at her from all sides. Waves of panic washed over her and she could hear her breath reverberating inside the mask.<br><br>Had she been damned, cursed to spend her days here, in this guise? Or maybe this was another test? Maybe she hadn’t failed at all? John always thought one step ahead of everyone else, planned for every eventuality, and he would never give up on her, surely?<br><br>Jigsaw may have gone but he had passed her onto another. A being for whom she would be The Pig again.<br><br>Ultimately, she saw now that she had been right in the choices she had made. The time for games was over. There was no chance of redemption for any of them. They were meat, and meat was destined for slaughter. 
    Her new style freed her, allowing her to dive into a fresh start.

We had cans of paint and a lighter as a weapon… but I don’t know what the hell these things are… but they don’t seem possible… like they were sent by Mother Nature herself to stop us from… I don’t know… doing all the damage to the world we’re doing… anyway… we didn’t find her and when we returned back to the cannery… thousands of spiders had burst out of Casey’s body and were… eating what was left… and we set them on fire and then put’em out… we’re still here… but we can’t stay for long… these things… they’re from hell or I don’t know… someplace darker… if there is such a place…  

We seem to have lost Elan and his brother. We can only hope and pray for their safety. And now… now we are getting reports of chaos and panic in the city. A mother and her daughter were trampled to death at the grocery store when hundreds rushed the entrance for bottled water and other supplies. We’d like to remind our listening audience to stay at home and let the government handle the situation to avoid further tragedy… wait… what was that… I’m hearing… is that hissing… do you hear it… shit…

    105.7 FM. Falls City Radio Classics. I’m Mat Rivers with the latest report we have on the blackouts in the city. Unconfirmed reports describe spider-like creatures attacking the Falls City Power Company. Online rumors suggest a biological terrorist attack unlike anything we’ve seen but no organization has stepped forward to claim responsibility and nothing has been confirmed officially. What we do know is generators at the power company exploded into violent flames taking down powerlines leaving the western sector of the city in the dark. City Police report these unknown creatures attacked several automobiles near the company and are considered extremely dangerous. At least three motorists are dead and four others are in critical condition. Motorists are urged to avoid roads near the power station and the 93 South. That’s the latest we have on the attacks. We’ll keep you informed as the situation develops. We now return to Money-Bake with the latest advice from our financial analyst brought to you by The Now-or-Never Wealth Management Firm… because you can never be sure what the future will bring.

    He’s paralyzed with indecision. As the crowd streams by, he appraises their hands. Long fingers, stout fingers, pristine, and ugly. Don’t be greedy now, you get one. Gotta keep things quiet, the fuzz will be snooping after the trapezist’s ‘accident.’ He spots a candidate worth his attention: three inches on the left hand of a young woman. Smoother knuckles than the norm. What does it taste like? Candy apple, maybe. Or... brass? Why brass? With considerable effort the memory arises: a first-grade teacher with a similar finger who used to wear cheap rings. He was a brat but she was too hard on him. A burst of endorphins tickles his spine. How would he immortalize this stand-in for his first-grade teacher? A sharpened pencil to her jugular? Stupid. Obvious. Pandering to irony. But also, satisfying in its cartoonish simplicity. Wait—what about the plump man with plump fingers? Thick sausages ready to burst with the slightest pinprick. A reminder of the mailman who yelled at him for flinging dog crap at a car. Bastard. I was just a kid having fun. Could fry up that finger and feed it to the local mutt. The fantasy is liberating. A righting of wrongs. And then... he sees it. The one. He shudders, recoils like he’s seen a ghost, but is suddenly drawn to it, unable to look away. It’s the finger he’s always searched for, always longed to make his own. Attached to a hand, to an arm, to a man with a very stupid moustache. He has found it: the Finger of Chaos. 
    I was woken mid-slumber by a delirium of shrieks and destruction so that I rushed to the closest window to see only the endless black fog swirling outside. Things in the fog were coming to life and dying simultaneously as though The Entity were sick or in some kind of shock. Creatures roared and fought and tore each other apart somewhere in the raging abyss and it was both entertaining and unsettling. I grabbed a nine iron and held it at the ready, waiting for some apparition to attack me. But within moments it was all over, and I couldn't sleep, and so I  took the edge off with a little whiskey and golf on the roof the whole while cursing this blasted Old One and hoping what I had just experienced was nothing more than cosmic indigestion.

The publishers think he's an idiot. What is he saying Story-Hook when he means Story? Ads with a story. A story with a Story-Hook. Rose calms Lazar down. She suggests that they should self-publish. The idea silences Lazar. You're right! You're absolutely right! The publishing world isn't ready for my visionary ideas. Dwight sighs and finds it harder and harder to listen to his bullshit. Peak 22 is going nowhere fast. The company is having a hard time finding clients and recruiting with all the rumors of abuse. Lazar announces he has a solution for recruitment. He'll write a Story-Hook recruitment campaign to attract the best employees.  Hundreds will apply. Thousands.  Dwight doesn't understand. For what? Dwight still isn't sure if Peak 22 does anything other than enable a narcissist to do whatever he wants to whomever he wants.

    When the trial begins, the first thing most Killers will try to do is locate some Survivors. Survivors must repair generators to escape, so Killers are likely to encounter Survivors in the surrounding areas.

    Honoring his family name was never enough for Kazan Yamaoka. He wanted to surpass his father’s reputation and end what he saw as the thinning of samurai culture with farmers often posing as samurai.  His father tried to turn Kazan’s attention to more noble pursuits, but Kazan refused to heed his advice, and borrowing his father’s katana, he embarked on a dark pilgrimage to prove his worth and rid Japan of imposters. Ignoring the code that had been taught to him, Kazan killed imposters in the hills and the valleys, on the beaches and in the woodland. The killings were brutal, cruel and morbid. He humiliated farmers and warriors alike, yanking off their topknots and stripping them of their armor. His rage, bloodlust and perverse sense of honor knew no bounds. Monks believed he was possessed by something dark and otherworldly and cursed him while a noble lord began to call him ‘Oni-Yamaoka,’ the rageful samurai, an insult both to Kazan and his family.<br><br>Determined to redeem his family’s name, Kazan now butchered anyone who dared call him Oni-Yamaoka. The insult confused him. He had defeated the best and he had purified the samurai class by ridding the land of imposters. How could anyone refer to him as an ogre? Had it been because he had marched onto a battlefield to cut down the fiercest warriors. Had it been because he had taken a kanabo and dashed hundreds of skulls with it?  Or had it been because of his need to secure a ‘trophy’ from his victims. It didn’t matter. Being called an ogre was more than he could bear and an ominous voice in his head urged him to strike down the lord who had desecrated his name.<br><br>As Kazan made for the lord’s town, he suddenly found himself face to face with a samurai standing on a dirt road, blocking his way. Kazan readied his kanabo. Without a word, the samurai attacked and quickly secured the upper hand. But he hesitated. With a devastating blow, Kazan crushed the samurai’s head and cracked his helmet. As Kazan approached the fallen samurai, he saw his father’s face and staggered back to his haunches. His father stared at Kazan with mingled shame and regret as he issued his last breath. Kazan closed his eyes and screamed in agony until he could scream no more. When he opened his eyes again… his father was gone. Not only had he killed his father, but he had allowed thieves to steal his body for armor.<br><br>Bitter, lost and disillusioned, Kazan roamed the land aimlessly with his father’s voice rattling in his head, taunting him, reminding him of his failures, sending him into fits of uncontrollable black rage. One day, walking in the woods, Kazan happened upon an Oni statue. He stopped and stood motionless for a long moment. The weathered and overgrown statue seemed to be ridiculing him, accusing him of being the imposter samurai he had so desperately sought to destroy. Kazan shook the laughing voice out of his head and half remembered the lord who had ridiculed him as ‘Oni-Yamaoka.’<br><br>With renewed anger, Kazan journeyed to a town high up in the snowy mountains where the lord resided. A dozen samurai met Kazan at the gates of the town. A dozen samurai fell to his kanabo. His speed and strength were unmatched. His rage was incomprehensible. Covered in blood and gore, Kazan battled through the town and soon found the lord hiding in a villa. He dragged him out of a cabinet, sliced his tendons to immobilize him and watched him beg and squirm like a dog. Without hesitation, he thrust his fist into the lord’s mouth and yanked out the wicked tongue that had desecrated his name.<br><br>Satisfied, Kazan exited the villa to find himself surrounded by dozens of farmers wielding rusted scythes, sharp pitchforks, and heavy clubs. He survived the first few assaults, but there were too many attackers coming from every direction. Within moments Kazan was on the ground staring at a cold, indifferent, darkening sky as farmers took turns stabbing and torturing the ‘Oni’ who had butchered their beloved lord. The frenzied mob dragged Kazan into a small stone mill to continue the torture and finally left him to die a slow, agonizing death. When they returned, the mill was filled with a strange black fog and Kazan’s body and the kanabo were nowhere to be found. It was the beginning of a dark legend about a rageful Oni haunting the town.

    Nea is amazed at how many poor communities shower, bathe, cook and do their laundry in poison water because a few kings bought the rights to their good water. It's absurd. Ridiculous. Unbelievable.  She's never felt so involved in a cause before and she likes the feeling. Possibly her first cause since school tried to stifle her voice with fear of making mistakes… of saying something… of having a message… of going against the corporate dream. Not the American dream, the corporate dream. Nea surfs the net and reads about the kings and their scramble for fresh water all over the world. She's happy to read it's not going so well. In every country where these tyrant kings tried to own fresh water they were kicked out by the people. Yet these stories are difficult to find. Kings losing battles to peasants is rarely breaking news or news at all. Almost like the kings want to make sure no one gets inspired to fight against them as they desperately scramble to buy up all the water they didn't poison. They want it all. They want to sell it. And they don't want peasants getting in their way. Water is everything.. Owning water is like owning life. Owning water is deciding who lives or dies. And that's what the kings and the mayor did in Falls City. They condemned and poisoned an entire community and did nothing to help them. And did nothing…  Nea hopes in a higher justice, one that can't be owned or bribed, and she swears she'll turn the mayor's new luxury car into a work of rebellion. Can't change the world, but you can make it a little bit better. A little bit better... that's enough for her.

    I have used the Auris to explore the memories of an unknown survivor who comes from a world where, from what I can gather, a cult for The Entity exists. It's not a surprise, or the first time I've seen such a thing, but the memories suggest she was a detective of sorts trying to prevent a cult sacrifice before she was snatched for the trials. I'm not sure what happened to her and will have to explore the fog to unravel more.

    I’m tired of waiting!  

Jake grabs a few branches, sets them ablaze and tosses them into the dark, gaping mouth of the cave. He watches the darkness fill with lashing, flames and swirling, smoke, and he waits for the inevitable. As he stares at the thickening smoke, he’s reminded of a story and his thoughts drift away to his grandfather.  

He reunited so many broken families. He helped so many people survive exposure, exhaustion and starvation. He saved them all and yet... he couldn’t save himself.  

They said there was a kind of smoke, too... a thick black smoke that suddenly surrounded them. One minute he was there. The next... he was gone. The survivors Jake had spoken to in Seoul said he was probably captured and executed but that they didn’t know for sure.  

A piercing squeal followed by a meaty thunk suddenly brings Jake back to the moment. He didn’t even see the hog make a dash for it. He leans over the pit and stares at the skewered hog shaking and convulsing as life pours out of its wounds.  

Jake sighs and feels mingled relief and regret. Sorry, brother… it was either you or me.

    Acquaintances are a dangerous deception. Our workplace is filled with them; strangers beside us, five days a week. A distant familiarity grown from habit; the blanks filled with assumptions as we forget how little we know, until proven otherwise.<br><br>The Ghost Face took full advantage of the fact. His entourage at the newspaper could have spotted that the Roseville murders led to him. There were clues: the days he missed work, the victims’ time of death, and the detailed articles he wrote citing sources he never shared. But his coworkers did not see. Ghost Face blended into the everyday.  No one thought the man seated on their left could be responsible for the murder of a dozen people. Until proven otherwise.<br><br>In the end, The Ghost Face would have gotten away with it as he had before: he would have packed his bags when the investigation pointed in his direction, driven a few miles, and looked for another job. But this time he found a richer hunting ground…

    Dead by Daylight is an asymmetric game. Each side in the trial has certain advantages and disadvantages:<br><br><b>The Killer</b> is an unstoppable, solitary monster. Killers see the world from a first person perspective. They each have heightened senses, deadly weapons and a unique power that helps them locate, chase, injure, catch and hook Survivors.<br><br><b>The Survivors</b> are a team of 4. They can choose to cooperate or to look out for themselves. Though they are weak and vulnerable, Survivors can use their small size to quickly vault through windows, leap over pallets, or find hiding spots. The Survivors have a wide third person perspective which gives them an advantage in situational awareness.

    She waits for an inspiration that never comes. Nothing except that lonely, ominous melody. The more she tries to strum something else… the louder it echoes in her mind. She stops for a long silent moment. But… the tune doesn't. She closes her eyes and tries to force it out of her mind but… it's not in her mind. It's coming from the cave. It can't be. She shakes her head. The tune fades as she returns to zero and tries one last time to connect with her muse. Her real muse, regretting all the paid gigs that drove her further and further from who she was… who she really was. She closes her eyes and counts down. Five. She relaxes her toes. Four. She relaxes her legs. Three. She relaxes her torso. Two. Her hands. One. Her lips, her nose, her face. Zero. She silences her thoughts.

It's not like she can produce him. Another pang of nostalgia. Another sip of Caipirinha. She misses it. Hunting new talents. The raw creative chaos of designing a bold sound. The adrenaline rush of the first album. Things are different now. Her time is split between handling the Trickster's growing ego, and following a generic, endless production cycle. <br><br>Is this the cost of success? Producing music that makes her cringe? Not to mention handling arguments about bodyguards and curfews while being threatened by a crazed, psychotic fan. <br><br>Her life is so different from what she imagined as a little girl. Back then, music was the only good thing she had. She created tracks in her bedroom, imagining a stage of bright lights where she was safe, loud, and free. That is what Pop music is to her: a vital dose of unapologetic release. But now, thanks to her success, she lives in a golden cage. <br><br>Down goes the Caipirinha. <br><br>The bartender gives her a glance and she nods. Keep them coming. <br><br>She calls Mightee One executives for a virtual meeting and gives them the news. Once she finishes the three tracks in Rio, she is done with the Trickster. She will move on to producing the launch of trainees. <br><br>A Mightee One executive cuts her off. They have more urgent business to discuss. Damaging rumors are trending online. A disturbed, delusional fan claims to have murdered someone at a Trickster concert. Yun-Jin closes her fists, her long manicured nails digging into her palms. Anything to keep her hands from shaking again. <br><br>She will handle this mediatic storm—for her brand's sake. But after Rio, she is done with the Trickster. Whether Mightee One is willing or not.

    The old run-down cowshed was one of the first barns the Thompsons built on Coldwind Farm. It was originally intended to house sick animals at a safe distance from the rest of the livestock, but no animal who entered it ever survived. An investigation revealed the building was infested with toxic mold. The Thompsons figured it must be a construction fault or something to do with the dampness of the wood. A new barn was built, and the old cowshed was left to rot in the shadows.

    Yun-Jin leaves her security detail behind during the Trickster's rehearsal. What she is up to is not strictly legal, after all. <br><br>She shows her VIP badge at the doorman and enters the Trickster's changing room. Perhaps she could find something in here that could be a clue as to what the Trickster is up to. Amidst the flamboyant costumes, she looks for a clue: receipts, notes, pictures. All she finds is a gym bag. <br><br>Inside lies a water bottle, a few t-shirts, and his wallet. No bills or anything of interest in his wallet… except for his hotel room keycard. Perhaps she is looking in the wrong place. Someone chatting loudly on the side of the door alerts her. She snatches the hotel keycard and zips up the bag just as the Trickster's assistant walks in. <br><br>Yun-Jin quells her thudding heart and keeps her expression impassive as she walks out. Whatever the assistant saw, she will not dare mention it, at least not to anyone who matters. <br><br>Yun-Jin only pauses when she reaches the Trickster's hotel room, keycard in hand. If she does this, there is no turning back. Yet if the Trickster is hiding something, she needs to know what it is, before everyone else does. Before it ruins her life. There can be no doubts. Yun-Jin pushes the door open. <br><br><b>***</b><br><br>The Trickster's room is tidy. Almost as if he barely spends time here. She goes through his luggage. A pile of odd clothes. All-black hoodies and sweatpants. A black facemask. Clothes she's never seen him wear on tour. <br><br>A tap on the door.<br><br>Room service. Yun-Jin drops the facemask. Come back later. <br><br>She finds nothing odd in the room, except for a rare, top-of-the-line sampler on his bedside table. Intrigued, she presses play. A series of loud, violent screams fill the room. The screeches sound… genuine. Samples from a horror film? <br><br>Yet she cannot fully shake her initial, disturbing thought. What if it is… genuine? <br><br>What she finds next only enhances her discomfort. A sharpening kit for knives. Wet stones and cleaning products. A whole collection of sharpeners. <br><br>A past conversation overheard at the recording studio replays in her mind.

Sure, the Trickster used real knives to do stunt work as a kid, but it is no longer necessary. This obsession with knives is not just for show.

    Carter hasn’t had this much fun since he first tried to transplant a mouse brain into a rabbit.  A week isn’t enough. He wishes he had more time. He needs more time. There are new avenues within the mind to explore.  Too many avenues, not enough time. He wishes he had the tools to operate on their brains. There are knives in the kitchen. Could work. Not surgical precision. But… but enough. He’s read about a gland in the brain that looks like an eye. A gland that supposedly secretes DMT. A kind of mystical drug. He wonders if he can extract it from a living subject. He wonders what a good dosage of human DMT does to a test subject.

    THE DISPOSED
    Dr. Morell and I worked tirelessly for three days and found a candidate for mass production. Toxin HJ7 killed 100 percent of arachna specimens in less than a minute. One dose and the creatures disintegrated into a thick puddle of bubbling, black tar which very quickly evaporated into a poisonous mist that killed the other arachnas we held in captivity for our experiments.  I think both the doctor and I were shocked and amazed at the result. While it is true that we might not know where these monsters came from, we now have a way to eliminate them.  The doctor and I are currently looking for ways to get samples of the toxin to other survivors.  The office worker turned cook volunteered, but Dr. Morell chose a few other unlikely candidates. She says it’s because he has a track record of messing up his assignments. Personally, I think that’s just an excuse, and the truth is… she’ll miss his cooking… his pizza. Helps her remember better days before the invasion. Helps us all remember better days, I suppose.

    The hunt begins. This is Jeffrey’s moment. The anger and revulsion fades, if only for a few minutes, allowing him to exist in comfort. He doesn’t stumble or slow as he stalks through the deep darkness. Takes sure, steady steps. He wants to remember this moment. It’s simple. One man with a wonderful finger. One clown that’s going to kill him. If only that was the whole of history, the entirety of existence. Wipe out the jealousy, betrayal, and greed, the tax collectors and nosy neighbors, the dogs that bark all night, the women who lead men on, the endless stream of cars, and the suitcases full of lies. Erase the whole overwhelming thing, the pain that ties it together—he doesn’t want to be a part of it, he was never good at it anyway. Leave one simple moment: A clown, a man, and a murder.<br><br>He’s jolted from his tranquility as a branch snaps underneath his foot. Thirty paces ahead, Moustache straightens up like a meerkat, swings his head around. He knows something’s out there. Something unseen. Hello...? Please... is someone there... I don’t know what’s happening. Jeffrey chuckles. Neither do I.

    I have uncovered to my amazement and bewilderment memories of Claudette that are unlike any of those I've previously experienced. One might even say they should not belong to her… and yet… they are hers. I surmise these memories may belong to another Claudette from another terra world, suggesting that this Old One may have clear preferences at the cosmic buffet for certain souls. It will take more samples of these memories to know if they are in fact from another Claudette or if, and it is possible, I am having troubles deciphering between her actual memories and her creative musings.

    STREET REBEL
    Lisa Sherwood grew up in a quiet town. The people of the village were kind, and the elders helped settle their disputes and keep the old traditions alive. Lisa was particularly fond of the charms they taught her to draw for safety and good fortune. One night, as she was walking home through the woods, a terrible storm struck without warning. In the slick wet darkness, she lost her footing and struck her head. Slipping in and out of consciousness, she watched dark shapes approach between the trees. Soon they were close enough for her to make out their evil, hungry grins.<br><br>They kept her chained to the wall in a flooded cellar. Through the gloom, she could see others, whose open wounds swarmed with flies. They did not survive long once the cannibals began carving bites from their bodies with their rusted blades, but somehow Lisa persisted. Starved and mutilated, her gaunt arms became loose in their shackles. She pulled, and the metal tore through skin and muscle until she was free. Her flesh oozed viscous yellow pus and bones were visible beneath gangrenous wounds. She could go no further. Delirious, she thought of home; she thought of the elders. She traced the symbols they had taught her. A dark hunger stirred inside her. It yearned for blood. She chose vengeance.<br><br>The police search eventually brought them to the old house in the swamp. Its inhabitants had been dismembered and devoured. The elders’ charms were scrawled in blood on the floor. Lisa’s body was never found.<br>

    Once a Killer catches a Survivor, their next goal is to carry them to a sacrificial hook. <br>While being carried, Survivors can wiggle and attempt to break free. Their struggles will affect the Killer's movements. The Survivor will eventually succeed and escape the Killer's grasp, so there is a limited time to transport the Survivor.

    It's just a cap. Pretty sure luck has nothin' to do with it.
    In the sweltering barn he stares at the blood dripping from his hammer feeling as though he were in a dream. Strange. Weird. Unhinged.  No. Not a dream. More like… like he's living on a TV show… watching himself from a distance.  Slaughtered cows thick and wet all around him. Seven or eight of them writhing helplessly in warm, coagulating blood. Heads cracked open. Brain and gore spilling out. Flies buzzing around him, buzzing in his face, buzzing in his ears, telling him this slaughter is who he is. This senseless slaughter is his worth... his only worth. Kill. That's what they love to watch you do. Kill. Kill. Kill. The flies are laughing at him. Laughing with Chief and his deputies.   Telling him he's so useless he don't even have a name.  Boy! What kind of name is that! His Pa shoves him toward another cow. You ain't done yet!   
Boy raises his hammer and shakes blood from his eyes. He feels strange. Weird. Unhinged. Fed up. He's had enough of this life. The cell. Shoveling manure. Slaughter. Endless slaughter. And taking care of those pigs. Those prized pigs—pigs given more love by his parents than he ever got. The flies circle his face and laugh at him. The high-pitch whining returns. The pigs got names and you didn't! Duke and Donny. He swats at the flies. Pa nudges him. Come on, Boy, show'em you can do more with that hammer! Boy… That's what Pa calls him.  Boy… That's what Ma calls him. They think he's too dumb to know he doesn't have a name. A real name. He knows.  All his life he knew. He knew and imagined himself as Max... Max Thomson. Imagined his Pa was so proud of him that he gave him his name. How he dreamed to have his father's name... how he dreamed... Pa shoves him. Come on! Show'em! Show'em now! Boy feels his face fill with blood. His veins swell with fury. His temples throb maddeningly. The next moments are a blur. Blood and screams everywhere! Not bovine… human… the whining begins again and he's confused, searching for his Pa but not finding him.  
The whining stops and everything is muffled. He turns to see Chief charging him. What have you done!? Boy doesn't really hear him. It's like when Ma held his head in a bucket of water to teach him not to call or cry for her when he was a child. Everything's muffled, distorted, surreal.  Chief tackles him and grabs the gory hammer out of his hand. You killed'em!  Your Pa! Jim! Don! Ray! My men! My fuckin men! Boy pushes Chief off and tumbles out of the barn, drenched in blood, heading toward the main house, screaming for his Ma in the growing dusk.

    Jonah Vasquez saw the truth behind the veil. His gifted mind understood numbers in a way few could. Sunsets, architecture, a blade of grass—he saw more within them than eyes could gleam. He understood the language that explained them—mathematics—complex equations that continually played out around the universe to determine why and how we exist. Structures. Patterns. A law unbroken: physics.<br><br>His gift would have been overlooked had his family’s history of poverty continued for another generation. But some patterns are meant to deviate from their common course, and Jonah’s father strived to better his family with every muscle he had. What started as a job picking fruit near Fresno, California, eventually led to him owning a small mangrove. It wasn’t much, but it was enough to provide Jonah a stable childhood and education.<br><br>Though placed in advanced classes, there were few signs of Jonah’s brilliance to his peers. He was a normal boy with a few close friends, a passion for baseball, and an interest in ancient civilizations. However, when he was alone, his mind turned to numbers—and these, to Jonah, were the most fascinating of marvels. He delved into Fibonacci and Recaman’s sequences and was soon poring over complex equations from history's leading mathematicians.<br><br>On his 16th birthday, he received an unaddressed card. There was nothing within but the following numbers: <b>8, 25, 19, 44, 1; -20.37, -69.85; 13, 2, 26, 11, 1</b><br><br>It was a puzzle. Perhaps a gift from his math teacher or a relative who knew of his penchant for solving brainteasers. But somehow this was different. While he immediately recognized the GPS coordinates, quickly discovering they led to a location in Chile, the other numbers meant nothing to him. Every attempt he made led to failure.<br><br>Over time, he abandoned the puzzle, convinced it was flawed. He went on to university and, upon graduation, was hired as a codebreaker by the CIA. On his first day, written in his employee handbook, were the numbers from years ago: <b>8, 25, 19, 44, 1; -20.37, -69.85; 13, 2, 26, 11, 1</b>. A tension in the back of his neck materialized, a feeling that he was being toyed with. He returned to the puzzle, only to discover that his years of experience would reveal no new information. He couldn’t dwell on it—he had a job to do.<br><br>He was put to work deciphering messages from signal stations around Europe. Archived footage found that for twenty-three years dozens had been operating in an unknown capacity. Simple blinks of light hid complex codes that revealed disjointed information. It wasn’t much to go on, but he discovered the messages seemed to involve powerful and wealthy individuals from around the globe.<br><br>The project was abruptly shut down. All agents involved were transferred to other assignments. Jonah was moved to a covert task force in the newly formed democracy of Kwantana, where he intercepted and decoded messages from bands of rebels. His work enabled the U.S. to target numerous rebel locations. Then the bombs dropped.<br><br>It was discovered too late that the messages were decoys. Civilian casualties were staggering, the true numbers covered up by officials.  Jonah blamed himself. He saw firsthand the damage done and the families torn apart. He took a leave of absence but remained in Kwantana, surveying the damage. He had to do something. He cashed in his favors with one of the CIA’s digital security experts and infiltrated the rebellion’s computer network. From there, he took stock of the numbers, and made changes he thought no one would notice. Small amounts of money were siphoned from the rebels to those who lost their homes and loved ones.<br><br>It seemed like a smooth play, undetectable and bloodless—until the day the gunshots rang through his suite. Jonah hit the floor as glass shattered and holes punched through his walls. Grabbing his laptop, he broke his kitchen window and leapt to the neighboring building’s roof. Before he could even rub his throbbing ankles, the small house exploded into flames. He ran, not looking back. He climbed down to the alley, made his way to the slums, and concealed himself among rickety shanties of cardboard and rotting wood. A week later, he arrived at an American embassy, exhausted, dust-ridden, and defeated.<br><br>Before he could take a breath, he received a call from his chief officer at the CIA: "Was it worth it? You over this crusade of yours?"<br><br>He felt powerless. And so, he returned his focus to what was simple, what was black and white: numbers.<br><br>His chief officer gave him a new assignment, one classified to all but a few. His research on the signal stations had reached someone high up, and the project was re-opened under a veil of secrecy. Jonah dedicated his time to deciphering the codes, partly out of fascination and partly to forget the guilt that resided within him. What started with signal stations led him to something even more baffling: horror podcasts.<br><br>In the stories of campfire thrillers and slasher tales from around the world were carefully concealed codes. Sometimes numbers. Sometimes words. Each time, as if being a secret password or handshake, he found the following message: Sacrifice is rebirth. Hidden in the code was information on a network of powerful people, all working towards what, he didn’t know. There was chatter of summonings and rebirths, sacrifices and hunts. Jonah assumed much of it was red herrings attempting to mislead. Up late that night, he analyzed another code—this time concealed in a story of vampires. What he deciphered sent a chill through his spine.<b>8, 25, 19, 44, 1; -20.37, -69.85; 13, 2, 26, 11, 1</b><br><br>The numbers had returned. They haunted him. He saw them when he closed his eyes. They clung to his sleepless mind, begging for attention. He checked the coordinates as he had years ago—it was nothing but a Chilean graveyard. He logged into the CIA database and searched the history of the location. Only one hit came up: a cold case where bodies were found in the area, the corpses eaten by hundreds of crows.<br><br>Jonah couldn’t let the mystery go on any longer. The numbers had followed him all his life and he was ready to follow them. Knowing his chief officer wouldn’t approve, he booked a ticket to Chile without anyone’s knowledge. It was time to see what was so special about the coordinates. Less than 24 hours later he arrived at –20.36, -69.85. He found himself under the sweltering sun, standing in the graveyard of a ghost town.<br><br>There was nothing but dust and bones. Jonah spit into the dirt and puzzled over the numbers once more. He slumped next to an old grave, under the eyes of a watchful crow. He missed home, he missed the mangrove, he missed a time before the complexities of the universe crashed down on him. He looked out at the old derelict buildings on one side and the sweeping desert on the other. There were similarities to Fresno—the dry heat, the sunset that cast an orange glow on the dusty ground. But it wasn’t home. Not to him. He looked at it from the eyes of a man who didn’t belong in this place.<br><br>And then Jonah understood.<br><br>He was analyzing the code from his own experiences, his own view of the world. There was so much he overlooked. With feverish devotion, he considered what the numbers could signify for other cultures: ancient Egyptian measurements, Persian currencies, and... antiquated calendars. He finally understood.<br><br>He sifted through his knowledge of ancient civilizations before coming to the Tanyrian calendar. Plugging in the numbers as dates, he converted the first half of them over to the Gregorian calendar. He wasn’t prepared for the number it would reveal: his birthday. The world spiraled around him. With sweaty palms, he calculated the remaining numbers. It gave him another date: today.<br><br>The code... it was about Jonah, at this location, at this moment. His hands shook. His heart pounded against his ribs. Was he part of a prophecy or had someone led him down this path? He didn't know. For once, numbers no longer made sense.<br><br>A heavy fatigue came over him and the world shifted in impossible ways. He knew the equations behind nature, he knew what he saw couldn’t be. He witnessed his father’s mangrove beyond the desert and felt overwhelming comfort. Crows cawed in the distance and the smell of citrus wafted on the breeze. He considered that he was once more a child, and the numbers nothing but a horrible dream. Trapped in nostalgic thoughts, he didn't notice the dark fog seeping from the grass, swirling its way towards him. Crows flew from the branches, screeching relentlessly, flying in a circle above. It was too late when he realized the scent on the breeze was no longer citrus.<br><br>It was blood. 
    It’s here.<br>The Entity is here.<br>It has found me.

    A Return to Form
    When she was five years old, Adiris, the youngest of a family of seven, was left on the brick-red burning steps of the Temple of Purgation at the center of Babylon. To process her shock and sorrow, she held onto the belief that the gods had a plan for her. Her new life was one of quiet servitude. She would tend to the gardens, prepare ceremonial meals, and polish ceremonial incense burners. At night, she would pray for a sign that would reveal her purpose.<br><br>When she came of age, she attended the high-ranking priests during the yearly worshiping of the sea-goat, the god of water and creation. Swinging a censer down the great hypostyle hall, she cast thick black fumes that reached the cold towering stone pillars before dissipating. Her worries lifted, and the resulting bliss made her feel closer to the gods than ever. She worked herself to the bone each day that followed, fulfilling her duties while taking on new ones, as she aided the priests during purification rituals.<br><br>The priests were more and more in need of assistance. Cleansings were being performed daily to answer the demand from outside the high temple walls, where a catastrophic plague had resurfaced. Within months, the priests contracted the disease. It did not take long before they became too weak to perform any kind of ritual. Adiris, having assisted many purification rituals, was the only one able to carry on. The swelling panic had to be contained, even if by a novice.<br><br>Anxious before her first ceremony, Adiris visited the priests’s sanctuary chamber. When she lit the candles, she noticed a narrow opening at the back. Sliding through the gap, she reached a crypt hidden under the sanctuary. The chamber was bare except for the golden statue of a woman, who stood with outstretched hands, her fingers covered in jewels. It was the sign Adiris had been waiting for.<br><br>The great hall was packed with followers who bowed down as Adiris entered. She strode to the brick altar and grabbed a ceremonial dagger forged in silver, her ruby ringed fingers wrapping around the blade like claws. The sudden display of luxury intrigued the followers, who were struck already by her youth and beauty.<br><br>As she began reciting the epic of creation, a woman at the back swooned and collapsed. Adiris rushed to her and noticed the black blisters covering her feet. Without hesitation, Adiris grabbed her sacred blade and swung it at her own foot, severing a toe. Then she offered the bloody part to the gods, asking them to protect the woman.  A silence fell over the followers, who revered Adiris as their new priestess.<br><br>Tales of her wealth, beauty, and devotion began to spread across the city as quickly as the disease.  Soon, Adiris’s followers called her the High Priestess of Babylon.<br><br>But her faith was tried when she showed the first signs of infection; her cough became a mix of phlegm and blood, her neck erupted in abscesses, and her four-toed foot darkened. Ashamed of her condition, she began wearing a veiled headpiece and carried a censer that masked the rancid smell of sick that clang to her skin. Hoping to be saved, she kept performing the rituals, offering blessed water and food to her followers.<br><br>But no ritual could save her. In a desperate attempt to appease the gods, Adiris banished herself from the city. She traveled north with a few followers, venturing through the cold woodlands of Urashtu, until it was no longer possible to walk.<br><br>They camped in a damp cave, where Adiris lay in a pool of vomit. Her foot, which had turned black, was so swollen she could not go any further. Her followers and she realized the truth in that cave: they were all infected with the plague.<br><br>Kneeling among her retching followers, Adiris made one last prayer. The black fumes of incense rose into the damp air before being wiped off by a cold breeze.<br><br>Neither the body of Adiris nor her followers were ever found. Many told tales of her return, but no one truly knew what fate had befallen the High Priestess of Babylon.

    Ace doesn’t understand what happened. He had Wallace dead to rights. His winning horse confidently slurped down the slugs one at a time as though he were enjoying a bowl of fresh sushi. Then he stops with the last one dangling out of his mouth… cocky little shit... He smiles and swallows... but the damn slug doesn’t go down... not as he planned. Ace can see a lump oozing and squirming down his throat. It slithers down… but it must have tickled his gag reflex or something... because he instantly loses his smile. There’s a silence. The idiot begins to squirm uncomfortably in his seat. The crowd goes… Uhh-ohh… and all of a sudden… a projectile of slug-chum shoots out his mouth and Ace hangs his head realizing he just lost everything.  

Wallace laughs out loud and slaps his back. Told you so. Ace doesn’t say anything. Tell you what… double or nothing if you last five minutes with Mika James. Ace stares up at Wallace. What’s in it for you? Wallace narrows his gaze. Your lucky alligator’s tooth. Ace hesitates. Wallace smiles. What? Thought you were double her size and stronger? Ace looks at Mika, at Wallace, at Mika again and nods. I’ll knock her out in two minutes and then buy her a drink. Wallace smiles, stands, and heads over to the manager of the club to make the arrangements. Ace stands and figures he may as well introduce himself to the champ.

    I felt an uncanny and unseen presence in the Archives as I contemplated The Entity. I could hear the labored breathing of killers standing outside my prison. I looked out into the dark, raging fog and saw nothing… Either the Entity is aware of my presence and is preparing to send killers to put an end to my plans… or the memories of survivors are somehow merging with my personal memories and these sounds are mere side effects of overusing the Auris.  In the end it doesn’t matter. If I could end the Entity I would even if it meant my own demise. My life is little to pay for the salvation of the worlds it will destroy.

    Evan enjoys creating something from nothing. He's not an artist but he enjoys sketching and he hides his sketches from his father. His father forbids sketching. Sketching is for weaklings. Vagabonds. Gypsies. He wants Evan to do worthy things. He drags Evan to his most profitable mine. He teaches him how to manage maggots. He's hands on. Very hands on. Abusive. Violent. Brutal. The key is… to break them. Break their will. Break their spirit. Once broken a human is a tool that can be wielded to do anything. Broken. It's what he did to his mother. It's what he's doing to him. But… Evan still sketches. Sketching is defiance.

    Grand Opening
    Stories and journals are scattered everywhere. So much to read… and yet I find myself drawn to the scribblings and renditions of the unknown creator I'm calling the Mad Designer.  Journals filled with the wild sketches and musings of people I imagine are caught in other parts of this living dimension--people juxtaposed with other Terra worlds and timelines that make little or no sense to who they are or where they come from. The illustrations and notes are foolish, absurd and quite contradictory, and yet they bring moments of levity to my life which does the soul good. I suppose it's a form of absurd escapism I turn to when I'm not reading the more traditional stories. Interestingly enough, I found seventeen versions of a story featuring a killer named Evan written by seventeen versions of the same author from the omniverse. Seventeen similar stories with sometimes subtle, sometimes significant differences. What I find particularly interesting is how the stories are written as fiction in one world and non-fiction in another. It reminds me of Universus Alveo… a theory that suggests that the human mind might very well be equipped with a powerful networking mechanism that reaches out to other worlds for wisdom and knowledge from our other-selves. Some can use their minds in this way and others can't. The theory suggests that those who have experienced trauma in their formative years detach from their reality, allowing them to explore other realities and worlds with relative ease. Artists like magicians and shamans see small things in the big, unexplainable endless dream that is the omniverse and they bring these ideas or insights back to entertain, enlighten and inspire the world. Fiction in one world, non-fiction in another. Everything is real, or nothing is. And here in the Chamber of Blood there are countless horror stories of every variety.  So many that it seems to me that one of the unknown prisoners was collecting these stories as a way to discover more about their imprisonment, the Entity and the terrible screams coming from the surrounding abyss. Whether this true or not, I'm not sure, but what I do know is I spent the whole night reading my favorite stories out loud like my father used to do by the fireplace. And the entire time I couldn't help but wonder… How?  How could anyone have accessed and assembled such a rich collection of notes, journals and stories? I have no immediate answer, but I suspect by the texture and density of the fog that I may be in a place as complex, mysterious and misunderstood as a black hole—a living, breathing, all-consuming black hole, the serpent of infinity that gorges on its tail, that eats itself endlessly as it spirals downward into the cosmic, Fibonacci stew that is life incomprehensible.

    Logs, Stories, and Notes
    Hello! Anyone out there! I need a hand over here! Bill hears the cries for help above the agonizing groans of the infected. He spots a cage in the middle of all the chaos surrounded by the infected. He grabs his rifle and fires, splitting infected heads like watermelons. He approaches the cage with Zoey where he sees a man covered in blood. Out of the frying pan and into the cage. He laughs to himself. How'd you end up in this shit hole of a thing? The man sighs. Quit yapping and get me out. Zoey looks around. Something ain't right about this. She's got good instinct. Bill's feeling the same knot in his belly. The man smashes the cage. Just get me out of here before they come back! Bill lifts the butt of his rifle and smashes the padlock off the latch with a mighty clang. Merry Christmas, kid. The man smirks. I like that one, gramps, and I ain't a kid. Call me Francis. Francis steps out of the cage repeating... Merry Christmas... Merry bloody Christmas… Bill spits over an infected corpse sprawled over the rubble. That's my line. Find your own. Francis' smile grows. No copyright on a line like that. Bill knows what he's doing. They're kind of a pack and this ain't about a line. This is about who's calling the shots. A lot of brass for a civilian. Truth is no one is really in charge in this shitstorm and we all gotta take the lead in some way or another and he's too stupid to understand. He oughtta break him now before things get stupid. Set him straight. He inches closer to the man. Zoey sighs. Boys… it's just a goddamn line. A sudden clicking sound behind them and Bill senses they're screwed. They turn to face three men with guns trained on them. Out of the cage and into the blazing, goddamn fire. Francis sighs. Shit... Canadians. Bill looks'em over. A group of men in make-shift hazmat suits and rifles. We ain't Canadians, now move! Bill looks to Zoey and Francis and goes sotto-voce. They're survivalists. Francis scrunches his face. So what are you saying... you saying they're worse than Canadians? Bill doesn't know how to respond to this. He fought with Canadians. Damn good soldiers. What's your beef with Canadians? Francis shrugs. What isn't?

    Jeffrey hurries into the circus tent, anticipation buzzing through his veins. He stands at the back of the bleachers, avoiding the gawking, idiotic crowd. All eyes are glued to the trapeze artist swinging above. Ha, they have no idea! The best comedy is unexpected, and only Jeffrey knows the punchline: he greased the second trapeze an hour ago. Spotlights, a drum roll, the acrobat flips through the air, grabs the next trapeze and whoops—slips right off. Down, down... splat. The sudden and exhilarating crunch of breaking bones. But nothing compares to the splat. The splat makes it all worth it. Like a ripe tomato thrown against a wall. And then, silence. A hundred people in shock. Trauma forming in their brains. Future nightmares being scripted. The moment broken by a single woman’s scream, followed by a hundred more. Jeffrey can’t hold it any longer. He bellows laughter, nearly suffocates with glee. No one can hear over the turmoil. Half the crowd rushes to the exit, needing air, needing to be sick, needing a stiff drink. What a show! Jeffrey chuckles, wipes his tears, and then—oh my. His eyes glaze over. So many fingers pass by. Hundreds of them. He’s a kid in a candy shop, and the possibilities are measured by the handful.

    105.7 FM. Falls City Radio Classics. We are back in the Falls City newsroom. For those of you just tuning in there is a strange disturbance in the area. Spiders of unknown origin of all shapes and sizes seem to be advancing toward residential areas, but authorities are asking everyone to remain calm and that the military is on its way to contain the anomaly. There are reports of similar phenomena in other countries and cities around the world but they have yet to be confirmed. And now we are trying to get whatever information we possibly can to keep you up to speed. And wait… this… this is just in… we have news that a group of teens have barricaded themselves in an abandoned cannery by the docks and are live-streaming attacks from what are clearly spiders the size of dogs. Two of the teens are the sons of our producer Sabrina Malkas. Sabrina’s desperately trying to get in touch with her sons Elias and Elan but can’t… she seems to recognize their friends… Casey… Ariella… Olivia and… she believes… Nina… It seems as though Casey may have inhaled the fog we heard about earlier and is complaining about headaches and nausea… and things crawling under her skin... we’re currently trying to connect to their audio feed to get a better sense of what’s happening out there. Please stand by.

He thinks he might need to grab her hair and punch below the belt just to get her to back off. But she moves faster than his eyes can track and he’s convinced his feet are turning to spaghetti. She stares at him like a hungry tiger and throws a roundhouse kick. He ducks. Laughs just as he feels her hands knit over his head and her wicked knee in his face. Black fills his vision. A moment later he’s on the ground swirling in a pool of stars with the crowd giving him a count in unison. He’s up at five with a fat lip and a pathetic smile.

    Rin was the only child of the Yamaoka family. She was raised in the dusty halls of a traditional house in Kagawa. She studied Education at Takamatsu, a private university, which weighed heavily on her family’s shaky finances. Her mother got ill that year and the bills started piling up. Rin worked part-time in a futile attempt to help lighten the load.<br><br>Her father faced a debt that grew without end. He started working double-shifts in hopes of obtaining a promotion. That’s when he started losing sleep. A dark whisper would keep him awake all night, reminding him of his hopeless situation. Exhausted, he started to lose grasp of reality. Fighting to deny what the voice whispered at night, Rin’s father made a desperate move. He met with his superior and explained his situation. He begged for a bonus, an advance, time-off---anything.<br><br>His request was denied. The company had launched a defective production line that was costing them dearly. Someone had to be held accountable and Rin’s father fitted the bill perfectly. He was fired after twenty-two years of service.<br><br>That evening, Rin came home from work. She’d stayed late to entertain customers that lingered at the restaurant. As she parked her bike in the shed, she heard her mother’s scream from the house.<br><br>She rushed in, climbing up the stairs to her parents’ room. There she found bits and pieces of her mother on the floor. Her limbs were clean-cut, tangled up in an unnatural position. Her breasts were sliced up, revealing her rib cage, which was cracked open. Rin gagged.<br><br>A sharp katana came crashing down. Rin blocked the blade, which bit into her bare forearm. The shock of recognition interrupted her pain: her father was wielding the katana with a stoic expression. She cried out to make him stop, but he slashed her arm again.<br><br>She rushed off and slid on the blood-smeared floor. Using the doorframe as support, she raised herself up. The katana ripped through the wall, cleaving her other arm. She screamed in pain as she limped into the hallway, only to be met by her father’s blade.<br><br>She stepped back, trembling, as she held together the soft loose flesh of her abdomen. Images of her mother’s tangled limbs flashed before her eyes.<br><br>Rin charged at her father, making him stumble back. He punched her torn abdomen and she reclined in pain. As she struggled to get back up, he slashed her thigh, making her collapse on the floor.<br><br>As she crawled towards the stairs, he grabbed her hair and yanked her against a partition. The glass shattered on impact and she fell through, landing one floor down.<br><br>She heard footsteps somewhere above her. With effort, she moved, worming her way into a sea of broken glass. The shards gnawed at her, ripping her flesh. He had to be stopped. He would not get away with what he’d done to her—with what he’d done to her mother.<br><br>Coughing up blood, her chin grazed the glass, adding to the bleeding. A low-pitched heartbeat started to ring in her ears. Her body felt so heavy she could no longer move.<br><br>The ground shook with her father’s footsteps. She knew she was not going to make it, but she no longer cared. She would make him pay, in this life or the next.<br><br>A dark Fog slowly veiled her eyes, but it could not subdue her rage. She would not rest—not yet. The darkness whispered, promising blood and revenge.<br><br>An oath was made and Rin closed her eyes.

    Carmina Mora was a gifted artist who carried the guilt of her young brother's death. Growing up a rugged coastal village in southern Chile, she sketched the sublime landscapes of Patagonia. Sitting outside, she painted dramatic fjords while feeding the crows nested in the tree next to the house. <br><br>She grew up carrying the guilt of her mother's sudden departure. Her father blamed Carmina for her mother's abandonment, which added to her grief. She became the caretaker of Matias, her little brother, despite still being a child herself. <br><br>A year later, Carmina was painting with Matias outside when the telephone rang. Her father remained in the yard, drinking his beer. Carmina rushed to the house to answer the phone and hung up a few seconds later. When she returned outside, Matias was nowhere to be seen. She asked her father, but he had paid no attention to Matias. She called her brother's name, looking for him everywhere. While searching, she saw a bright red coat floating on the narrow creek by the house--Matias' jacket. She jumped into the creek and found him floating on the surface with vacant eyes, unblinking. He had fallen and drowned. <br><br>Her scream tore the sky. Her father found Carmina sobbing on the creek's shore, clutching her brother's body in her arms, surrounded by a murder of crows. Her father snatched Matias's body away from her, and she cried until her voice broke. <br><br>The following morning, the world was cloaked in darkness. Her father did not say a word, because he did not have to. Carmina knew it was all her fault. Months passed, yet her loss was as fresh as morning dew. Crippled with self-loathing, she could no longer paint. Without Matias, life had no meaning. <br><br>On the bleak morning of Matias’s birthday, Carmina walked to a narrow bridge several blocks away from home. She was convinced that nothing could bring her relief. Her mother was gone, her brother was dead, and her father blamed her for it all. She was convinced that she had nothing left to live for. <br><br>Carmina walked to the railing of the bridge that stood over the turbulent river. Locals had nicknamed the spot DeathLeap. Several cars drove by Carmina, but none stopped. No one seemed to care. She climbed over the railing and her legs wobbled as she stood on the lip of the bridge. She looked down, watching the fierce river smash into a giant boulder. She closed her eyes.<i>See you soon, Matias.</i> <br><br>Suddenly, a cacophony of caws filled the sky. Carmina opened her eyes and saw a black cloud of feathers flying toward her. The cloud split open and glossy black crows dove from the sky. One landed on her shoulder and stared intently into Carmina’s eyes, as if peering into her soul. Her grip on the railing loosened and the crow cawed raucously. Carmina stared at the crow, confused. <br><br>Another crow landed on the railing, then another. Soon, a flock of crows were covering the railing of the bridge, staying close to her. She felt their heavy stare on her, calculative and enigmatic, as if they were assessing her. She looked down for a second and a thunder of caws interrupted her dark impulse.  The crows seemed to care about her wellbeing. As she dangled over the edge with the wind blowing through her raven hair, Carmina felt akin to them. For the first time since Matias had died, Carmina did not feel alone. <br><br>She returned home, giving life another chance. The crows left but Carmina suspected that if anything happened to her, they would return. <br><br>Inspired by her ordeal, Carmina picked up a brush. In the weeks that followed, she painted her experience, using black ink to depict the DeathLeap with a black cloud of feathers, the murder of crows that saved her life. The experience was transformative and launched her signature, black-ink surrealist art. <br><br>After several years, some color pierced the darkness, and this shift of medium expanded her art form. She painted large-scale murals on busy street corners, designed grandiose costumes, and recited militant poetry. Carmina’s art displayed local, intimate tragedies on a large scale, making them impossible to ignore. And everywhere she performed, crows followed. <br><br>Her performances grew bold and drew the attention of artists who found her style invigorating. She grew close to a group of painters who understood her iconoclastic vision. Her performances launched the Large-Scale Surrealist movement, which became a phenomenon. <br><br>Her renown grew enough to attract the commission of a multinational enterprise, The Vack Label. Carmina investigated the group, discovering that they gifted art pieces to select disreputable congressmen. Vack’s commissioned artists seemed to disappear afterward. <br><br>Determined to expose the group's link to corrupt politics, Carmina accepted Vack's commission. The following week, Carmina painted a giant mural on a cemetery's columbarium, displaying the Vack Label logo as a surrealist grim reaper harvesting the fields of Chilean families. She wore a theatrical dress as she painted, on which she had stitched a poem about political revolution. <br><br>The piece sparked a radical debate about corruption. The controversy painted a target on Carmina's back. After receiving anonymous death threats, she took refuge in her father’s house, bringing along her closest friends for safety. <br><br>That night, a gang of masked gunmen broke into the house. They swiftly subdued Carmina and her friends, threw them in a van, and drove off. <br><br>The following morning, a dry breeze blew sand on Carmina's face, awakening her. She was seated in a chair in the middle of the desert, with her legs tied and her hands handcuffed. Her friends were lying on the ground, tied up. A shadow fell over her face. Carmina looked up. <br><br> A man dressed in a long robe with his face hidden in a dark hood approached her. He pulled a silvery knife from his robe. <br><br>He grabbed her hands and recited a hymn in an unfamiliar language. Carmina held his gaze. He paused and brought down his blade with a sudden blow. <br><br> She cried in agony as her friends woke to a terrible sight; Carmina's severed hands falling in the sand.The handcuffs followed, landing into a pool of blood <br><br>The hooded man smiled in satisfaction. <i>How are you going to paint now? </i>Carmina cursed and screamed at him, wriggling against the bonds on her legs. <br><br> The man grabbed Carmina’s chin. She spit in his face. <br><br>He grunted and pried her mouth open, pulling out her tongue. Carmina struggled against his hold. In a violent blow, he chopped off Carmina's tongue. <br><br>She howled in anguish. The man wiped his blade on his robe, leaving a trail of blood. <i> How are you going to recite poems now? </i> <br><br> Sorrow swelled in Carmina's chest, sharper than pain. Overwhelmed by uncontrollable rage, grief and loss overcame her senses. She had lost her little brother. And she had lost the only way to cope with such pain. Carmina screamed like on the day her brother died. <br><br>Raucous caws echoed through the wasteland. The sky was obscured by a cyclone of dark clouds. Black feathers fell on Carmina's bleeding arms. She looked up and saw a torrent of crows erupting from the clouds, diving on the hooded man. <br><br>As the ravenous crows pecked at his flesh mercilessly, Carmina smiled, watching her Surrealist art coming to life. <br><br>But her heart lurched with rage when she saw the crows move on to their next target, her friends on the ground. She screamed as waves of pain, guilt, and fright overwhelmed her. But it was in vain, the ravenous crows were uncontrollable. <br><br>Darkness fell over her eyes as her friends' agonizing screams grew more acute. Death was coming and again, it was her fault. <br><br>A deep, black fog engulfed her.

    Anna finds these soldiers curious. Where once the Russians and foreigners were roasting each other alive… they are now… working together to survive her attacks. They are calling her a ghoul, a monster, of the forest, saying she is a bodark. Together the soldiers dig pits and sabotage their camp. Anna toys with them. She's outnumbered and she knows it. She weakens their senses by depriving them of sleep. Every night she approaches their camp. Sings a lullaby then howls like a bodark. The soldiers wake in a frenzy and scuttle in terror as she returns to her cabin to sleep with her little one. She rests for a few hours then returns to her little war to reignite a cycle of terror. One or two sleepless nights and they'll be ripping each other apart. It will be a matter of walking in and taking what belongs to her little bushka.
    May your voice reach the beyond; may your voice reach the beyond; may your voice... Adiris speaks this line until it becomes a single word, babbled in harmony with her fellow emissaries in faith. Ma-ya-voy-rethebe'on... Ma-ya-voy-rethebe'on... Thirteen women stand in a circle around a stone altar. Adiris' chant falters as time passes, her raw throat the only indication she contributes. Each enunciation, agony. She's nearly forgotten the naked man writhing face down on the altar, leather straps binding him.<br><br>The high priest Haban raises a hand. Adiris, along with each of the emissaries, stops, bows her head. She reminds herself: Cherish the pain, a sacrifice to the sea goat, the God of Water and Creation. The emissaries disperse, and Adiris wanders to the man on the altar. Tears stream from his bloodshot eyes. She wants to lend comfort, assure him the gods love him, perhaps even pull him from the altar, away from the coming pain. She smiles at him as she would a child. If only you understood the importance of your sacrifice, you would laugh with joy. Tenderly, lovingly, she kisses his forehead.<br><br>May your voice reach the beyond. 
    Philip enters another decimated village under the cover of darkness and sees a crew... A killing crew. Maybe the very ones who killed his guardian. Maybe the very ones who killed his grandmother… his parents. No hell is good enough for these demons who would take money to disappear people. They’re cooking something by a fire, laughing, and making jokes at the expense of those they butchered. They talk about his people as though they were animals. No. Less than animals. No one takes pride or ridicules the animals they slaughter. He’s never seen anything like it. Dogs without humanity, that’s what they are, dogs, rabid dogs, nothing less, nothing more. Something ancient tugs at him. He feels darkness like a tendril from another world take hold of his young, innocent heart. Not young or innocent, anymore. He hears Funanya’s voice. Forgive, and be forgiven.  

But he doesn’t want to forgive and he doesn’t want to be forgiven. He wants them to suffer like they made his people suffer. He wants them to suffer for taking everything from him. He hears his grandmother’s voice trying to distract him from his dark thoughts of revenge with infinite math problems. But over her voice is the raging, maddening heartbeat of his hate. Her voice screams out equations and challenges. But he glares at the men. He feels kerosene coursing through his veins and he’s ready to explode. An eye for an eye and the whole world plunges into infinite night. Good.   

Philip notices the guns by the jeep. He could grab one and shoot them all. But he’s never used a gun and they’d probably run away. He could find a knife or machete… but these dogs would overpower him… Just walk away, Philip. Never look back. It’s your duty to survive and bear witness. He ignores the voices in his head and only wants one thing. He wants them to suffer and disappear. He wants to… yes... take their kerosene and make them disappear the same way they made his friends and family disappear--in a swirl of smoke. And for a moment… just a moment… he is the angel of death swooping through infinite night.

    Don’t play with powers you don’t understand. Lisa’s grandmother scolds her for scratching a symbol into her textbook for good luck. Lisa apologizes for snooping through her things. She just wanted to know more about the old village-town and the stories of witches and cannibals that were burned alive or chased out. She heard her mother say her grandmother had come across several books written in an unknown language with strange symbols.  Her grandmother warns her to stay away from her books. You can attract great misfortune to yourself and others. Lisa wants to laugh but doesn’t. She was just messing around and doesn’t really believe in all this superstitious nonsense. No such thing as witches and cannibals, Gran. I was just hoping for a little luck on my algebra test. No harm, no foul. Her grandmother tells her the symbol she sketched was the very one she had used long ago to turn a cannibal into a gnarled, twisted, swamp tree covered in putrid, black ooze. It’s so ridiculous Lisa wants to burst out laughing but she contains herself as she listens to her tale of cannibals and missing children. When her grandmother finishes her story, Lisa hugs her and kisses her soft, wrinkled forehead. Don’t worry, Gran... I’m not going to turn into a swamp-tree or be kidnapped by a bunch of cannibals.

    All planes of existence are a unique mix of conscious Auric particles and material particles. The Entity is almost certainly pure consciousness… The observable fact of existence is the material world responds to and changes with consciousness… collective consciousness is the key… The body, the home, the trial—all of it is an expression of The Entity's unconscious need for fear and terror.<br><br>The distinct observation in the specimens chosen by The Entity is that they all come from worlds that have failed to understand the metaphysical relationship between their thoughts and the world they live in. This is not by chance. It is, to my mind, self-preservation. Victims who know this truth and have honed their ability to manifest could be poisonous to The Entity.  This leads me to believe The Entity is attracted to dark worlds because darkness and chaos are clear indicators that inhabitants have failed to connect the dots between the collective consciousness and the health of their world. The conclusion, then, might be that The Entity feeds off ignorance.

    This is not the Badham Preschool where children laughed and learned, made lifelong friendships and had their paintings hung on the walls. This is a dark echo created from the nightmares of those who suffered there. The walls creak under the burden of history. Events that should be long forgotten are recorded forever in the plaster and stone, pervading the building with misery. Only one part of the building is accurately reflected in this darkness. The squalid room where Freddy Krueger lived and worked. The hidden basement area where he committed the heinous acts that appalled a town and condemned him to death. This is a place of the subconscious, of the nightmare brought into hideous reality.

Most advertisements use stories to wrap a message in emotion. Just because you call it a Story-Hook doesn't mean it's new. Doesn't mean it's different. Story-Hook is a term used by high-school English teachers. Rose laughs. Yes, but Lazar's an idiot and he wants to feel like he created his own theory for his upcoming book. Dwight's eyes go wide. Book? What book? Rose laughs absurdly and explains. An autobiographic book. A guaranteed bestseller highlighting Lazar's new theory on creativity. But Lazar hasn't done anything yet. It's all smoke and mirrors. Rose laughs and corrects him. He's done one thing really well… He's burned through millions. Rose changes the subject and tells Dwight he needs to meet Lazar's ghostwriter for an interview. Make sure to shower praises about our naked emperor for his autobiography.

He’s the best in the neuroscience program. The best at The Lery… The Lery… It could only be The Lery. The Lery or The Allan. Two institutions with a history of working with the government to push the limits of psychology beyond the code. Not beyond the code. Despite the code.<br><br>The papers coming out of The Allan amazed him. Captured him. Inspired him. Had he been Canadian… it would have been The Allan. Or what many called, Ravenscrag. The experiments they conducted were brilliant. Cutting edge. Mind-shattering. He wishes he were a student in the fifties studying under Lord Crag. The nickname patients gave the genius at Ravenscrag. Lord Crag returned from the trials with ideas. Not cautionary tales. Not disgust like the other bleeding hearts who condemned the doctors who would, anyway, be smuggled into his country and be given the highest positions in government in exchange for their discoveries. Lord Crag took the experiments he had heard about to the next level and Carter… Carter hopes to do the same. But not with this professor. Not with Blanchard. Dr. Blanchard. Dr… Bleeding heart Blanchard. He has no idea what real power is. Real power is freedom. True freedom. Freedom beyond the limits of ethics and morality.

There are no gentle breezes to distract her, only the Broken Woman's voice prodding deeper. Did you not have a husband, sweet nurse? I recall the newspaper article... hand to heart, my dear, I cried at his unfortunate death. You would have had beautiful babies. To now be here, a widow of pure genes, serving the filth of the world—such a turn of events.<br><br>Sally gets up, leaving a bandage half-wrapped. Her feet shuffle imprecisely as she moves for the door. She tries to push her thoughts away, knows she shouldn't think it, but—it is such cruelty. Her love was pure, her husband pure, and those who live in these halls are anything but. Yet these sick, twisted beasts, receive the care and attention deserved to the man she lost.<br><br>Her throat catches on each breath. Her vision blurs. She wants to run but knows it's no use. No matter where she goes, she always finds herself back in these halls. With swirling thoughts, one stark realization breaks through: it is not she who keeps the insane confined to these halls, but the insane who confine her.<br><br>She falls to the unforgiving floor.

    Dwight showers Lazar with online praise using fake profiles. It's the coziest job he's ever had. As he prepares to create another false profile he suddenly hears shouts coming from Lazar's office. He freezes as Lazar verbally assaults the Peak 22 lawyer. The lawyer is telling him Story-Hook can't be registered. It's a concept in many high school textbooks. Lazar fires the lawyer on the spot. The lawyer promises he'll sue. Lazar doesn't care. He'll settle. He always settles. It isn't his money, and Dwight's heard he's got his benefactors eating out of the palm of his hands. He's already settled dozens of wrongful dismissals. Rose attempts to calm Lazar down, but he screams at her to mind her business.  Dwight wants to help her… but… he's… never made so much money doing so little before. He likes making money doing nothing. But… his hands are fidgeting and his palms are getting damp and clammy. Hearing Lazar verbally abuse Rose is difficult to bear. He imagines all kinds of scenarios where he leaps from his desk to help her. Nervousness fills his bladder, and he leaps from his chair and rushes to the bathroom.
    Yui accelerates through the fog with a red-eyed demon chasing her. She skids out of control, breaks her legs, and drags herself helplessly through the fog. Footfalls thunder toward her, shaking the ground with every step. She looks over her shoulder but all she sees is the thickening fog. A boot crushes her hand. She looks up to face--herself. Yui awakens in a hospital by Hiro covered in bandages with tubes sticking out of him. Authorities don't know it was an illegal race. If they did, they'd all end up in jail. She's not sure if Hiro can understand her but she tries her best to comfort him. Doctor says you're lucky to be alive. She wants to tell him he'll never walk again but she can't bring herself to do it. She doesn't say anything. She can't say anything. One lapse in judgement and he lost everything. Could happen to anyone. Yui closes her eyes and for a moment imagines a world where she hunts that bastard down and kills him like a dog.

    Deep in a forest with many names lies a hidden home. The family that once lived there was dependent on the forest… and was broken by it. More than a century old, the dwelling is in surprisingly good condition, though it shows signs of often being patched and mended. The forest holds the house tightly in its grasp, growing over and around it like a second skin. Only once inside is it clear that someone still lives there. It is warm and welcoming and lovingly decorated, with a large living space, a bedroom and a corner dedicated for little ones. Here they are protected from the harsh winter of the northern forest.

    Kenneth Chase was born in 1932 by a difficult labor, which his mother wouldn’t survive. This event drove a rift between him and his father that never closed. As the boy grew, so did his father’s resentment, and his drinking habit. By the time Kenneth was at school, they lived mostly separate lives.<br><br>Academically, he was unremarkable, coasting by on his significant athletic prowess. He grew tall and strong, excelling at track events, but shunned any attempts to coax him into team sports.<br><br>On his walk home from school, he would often find feathers on the ground and he soon began a collection, keeping them in a cigar box under his bed. With his father either at work or in an alcohol-induced stupor, Kenneth had hours to spend alone, transfixed by the regularity of the feathers’ barbs and feeling the softness as he ran them over his lips. Watching the birds that came to the feeder in his garden, he imagined how soft they must be and resolved to catch one. He ingratiated himself with the local dentist, soon procuring some anesthetic. Using this, he rigged up a trap on the feeder, that he hoped would knock out a bird long enough that he could touch it.<br><br>After a few failed attempts, he managed to trap a robin. As it lay in his hand, he felt a sudden rush, of a life at his mercy. He had planned to release it once it recovered from the anesthetic. Instead, as its eyes flickered back into consciousness and it began to struggle, his grip remained firm. His fingers slowly tightened around its throat, squeezing until its chest feathers were finally still. He disposed of the body, keeping just a feather, with which he started a new collection, discarding the others as ‘fake’.<br><br>By the late 1940s, Kenneth had left school and started working as a busboy at a local diner. He had also escalated to larger prey, like squirrels, raccoons and dogs, becoming skilled at customizing the anesthetic dosage for each.<br><br>In early 1954, a young man went missing and the town was turned upside down in the search. A few months later, Kenneth’s father, while doing some work in the crawlspace under the house, found a cigar box. He broke it open and saw, to his horror, that it contained feathers, animal paws, and a man’s finger.<br><br>Returning from work, Kenneth saw his father leaving the crawlspace with a cigar box in his hands. He turned on his heel and never went home again.<br><br>After a few weeks of living rough, he encountered a traveling circus and, with his prodigious strength, was hired to work the ropes. He assumed a new name: Jeffrey Hawk.<br><br>Suddenly surrounded by a close-knit community, “Jeffrey” had to learn to socialize. He donned a new personality like a disguise, quickly becoming known as charming and helpful, and was welcomed into his new family.<br><br>Over the next decade, he stayed with the circus, traveling the length and breadth of the USA. But, with the itinerant life providing few repercussions, he fell into bad habits. Drink, junk food, drugs, he indulged all of them to excess. For a time, these vices were enough, but then his old urges returned and his nomadic existence became a cover for him to resume killing. He stole clothes and makeup from performers, fashioning a disguise that would let him get close to his victims before he anesthetized them, bringing them back to his caravan, where they would awake to find themselves bound and at his mercy. He would finally get to have his fun, mentally and physically torturing them, their screams fueling him, before being lost in the night.<br><br>Once their strength was at its lowest, he would carefully examine their fingers, searching for the prettiest, running them over his tongue to find the tastiest. Once he found the best, he would cut it from their hand and proudly add it to his collection, disposing of the rest of the body as pointless waste.<br><br>Men, women, young, old, he didn’t care. The essence of a good collection is in the variety, in the memories and stories they evoke.<br><br>He removed the costume less and less, shedding his old personality with it, fully embracing the clown, his true self.<br><br>With time, he became complacent and sloppy. A victim managed to work free of her bindings while he was sleeping off the drink. She escaped, screaming for help, and he awoke to find the rest of the circus bearing down on him. He whipped his horse and the caravan disappeared into the night.<br><br>Since then he has roamed the country, a parasite who could always be found at a carnival or circus, but who would never been seen on any playbill. He lured those brave, or foolish, enough to come near, trapped them and moved on before they could be found missing.<br><br>Somewhere along the way, he left the ordinary roads of the USA behind him, traveling through a veil of mist and entering a new realm. It was a place of transience and impermanence, perfectly suiting the life he had chosen to lead. Feeling more at home than he had in his entire life, he set up camp and waited for his first visitor.

    The single child of a wealthy family, David King seemed destined for greatness. While growing up in Manchester, he demonstrated serious potential in both sports and academics, and with his family connections, all doors were open to him. He could have succeeded at anything, if it weren't for his combative nature. David lived for the adrenaline rush of a good fight and would go out of his way to get into one.<br><br>His robustness and athletic abilities led him to rugby, where he could cut loose and really cause a ruckus. King excelled and gained a reputation as a promising, if somewhat reckless, rookie. His meteoric rise came to an abrupt end when he lost his temper and assaulted a referee, earning himself a lifetime ban from the league and cutting short what most people assumed was going to be a long, successful career. King was unconcerned; money was no issue, so he took it as an early retirement and focused on other fun things to do.<br><br>Free from the constraints of a career and enabled by the wealth of his family, David King spent most of his time at the pub, drinking, watching games, and getting into fights. Some might say he was wasting his life away. Not many people knew that he was an occasional "debt collector" or that he fought in clandestine bare-knuckle fight clubs.<br><br>When David King stopped showing up at the pub, the few friends he still had were not surprised. They figured he had finally picked a fight with someone stronger than he was. In a way, they were right.

No one ever got famous with petty theft and arson. Maybe we should do something real. Frank leans forward. What does that mean? Something real? Julie goes quiet for a moment. She's not sure what she's thinking or if she's thinking at all but… she wants to feel the thrill she's read about in books. She wants to be more than common. More than ordinary. Bigger than life.

His eyes dart to examine the floor as he nervously licks his mouth.<br><br>Ahead, the Foul Girl skips gracefully, enjoying her first day out of restraints in a month. She hums a pleasant tune, tracing her hand over the wall. As Sally approaches, the Girl tilts her head forward. She lets out a long, guttural sound, heaving her diaphragm until vomit splashes onto the floor. Content with herself, she smiles and skips on.<br><br>Sally continues, giving no thought to cleaning the mess. She sees the Shoeless Imbecile sitting by the broom closet. Thick strands of blood drip from his mouth. With precise rhythm he slams his jaw into the doorframe six times, digs at his gums, and pulls out a tooth. He peers at Sally as if she's the strangest thing he's ever seen.<br><br>Sally looks out at the hallway, stretching on forever. She stops, accepting what she's tried to suppress: the sickness can grow no more.

    An engine echoes through the darkness. A roar vibrates through Yui's body as she accelerates through a thick churning fog across a wasteland of crumbling pagodas and buildings.  She passes a wrecked motorcycle on the side of the road. Not far from the bike a rider tries to stand but collapses on a shattered leg. She can't stop. She won't stop. She needs to win. She needs to reach the… she's not sure anymore... She looks left and right as she zips past the ruins of her hometown. She passes the same rider again trying to escape the blazing wreck. Doesn't make any sense. Nothing makes sense. A demon yells in the fog. Seems like he's right behind her, lurking in the fog, waiting to jump out at her.  She maneuvers through piles of flesh and gore of fallen riders burning and sending puffs of swirling smoke up into the darkness. She yells helplessly and the dead, smoldering riders begin to evaporate into a column of light breaking through the darkness. A rider suddenly stands in front of her. She skids, loses control, and tumbles over the road. Her insides feel like mush. Things are broken everywhere. Cracked bones rip through her skin, spitting out black, warm fluid. She tries to rise but a bone jutting out of her black jeans won't let her stand. Like the fallen rider she ignored, she's broken, helpless and soaked in gasoline.

    Kate screams in the lonely, desolate forest! She wants that tune out of her head. It's annoying her. Frustrating her. Blocking her. Even when she stops strumming her guitar the melody continues as though with a life of its own coming from everywhere and nowhere at the same time. She focuses for a moment and realizes the melody is echoing out from the cave. She surrenders to her dark muse. She stands and stares at the cave and sees… a pulsing light. She closes her eyes and feels that her mind's playing tricks on her. But she knows better. She knows she's always sensed and felt things others couldn't. She once heard someone say that today's shamans are our artists, authors and musicians… that unlike other people they are capable of accessing other thoughts, worlds and ideas from otherworldly realms. She always had that ability… but never like this… never so dark… it's as if the universe is punishing her for squandering her gifts. She approaches the deep and ominous cave wondering who or what is calling her. A vague memory tugs at her… tells her she's done this before. She has a sense that she knows what she's going to find but somehow has forgotten…

Too embarrassed of their deformed kid that they poured scalding water over him. Tried to kill you! Tried to make it look like an accident. Boy covers his ears. Flies buzz about, laughing. He doesn't want to hear this. A high pitch ringing echoes though his mind. Stop! Stop! Stop! But it won't stop. He knows he's the only one who can hear the whining and laughing flies. He knows he hears things. He knows his Pa hurt him. Hurt his head. Screamed too loud in his ear when he was a baby. Screamed mean things. Mean things like he wished Ma's belly-cord strangled him completely and not just halfway. He takes a moment to gather himself. He hears other voices. Chief called in more deputies. Doesn't matter. Let them all come. They all deserve to pay for doing nothing while his Ma and Pa made him suffer.

Carter exchanges a look with the men in black suits. He doesn’t understand. The imbecile enters and does the unexpected. He stares at the barely breathing student unperturbed. No fear. No panic. No emotion. Nothing. He grins and mumbles something to himself in German. He turns to Carter with a smile. His smile turns to a grin when the men in black suits handcuff and arrest him.  Blanchard whispers. Looks like you had your chance to make merry hell and took it. The cuffs are just for appearances. I… I… don’t understand. Yes… you do. You understand much more than the others.

    I was listening to a podcast of creepy stories with my friends... Adrien... Mia... Tina... and Bill. I can't remember which one of us figured how to do it... but we realized that the stories were codes to pass on coordinates of locations of interest for some group or cult or whatever. We decoded a few other stories and came to the conclusion that these people were sending encrypted locations of places where they believe there would be ghosts. We didn't buy any of that paranormal crap and we were just having fun drinking and decoding the stories and looking up the places on satellite maps. But when the coordinates of one story turned out to be close to us, we thought we could check out the place for fun. Adrien rented a car and we headed up to what was left of the crumbling asylum. There was nothing but overgrown ruins. But I remember this unnatural black fog and it was like we were at the asylum but some other version of it. It was really strange. And that's when we saw this thing… this giant samurai with a demon mask lurking about as though it had stepped out of one world and into another. He killed Mia first. I don't remember what happened exactly... I just saw... I saw her head thump and tumble across the ground. I don't remember much... I remember crawling out of the fog and that demon or apparition or whatever that thing was couldn't follow me…  like it was blocked by something invisible. Not long after a man who called himself Hans and who identified himself as a detective arrived and asked me questions about what I had seen. He took some notes and seemed a bit strange. Then when he heard the sirens approaching, he disappeared just like that. When the police arrived, the fog was gone leaving only the... the... hacked remains of my friends. And now I'm here... and you're telling that you don't know who that detective was and that you want me to show you how to crack the code of the podcast. But I can't because I don't know! That was my buddy Tina, and she's hacked to pieces you assholes!

    4 AM. Yui watches Hiro speed off and take the lead. Shinji and others follow close behind. Maybe her words did help. Hiro rounds the bend. She watches Shinji race beside him and lean in. He leans in close, extends his arm, and touches Hiro's shoulder. Just touches him. Not to push him or hurt him but to annoy him. To distract him. Hiro swears. Loses his focus. Loses control. An instant later he's skidding across with pavement with a wrecked bike leaving a trail of sparks and oil. His helmet is disintegrating layer by layer against the rough pavement like sandpaper. He needs help, but the other racers speed past him all trying to win the prize money. Hiro stands and staggers stupidly into the road. His helmet doesn't exist anymore, and his face has been razed to the bone. His mouth and lips are gone. There're just teeth where lips used to be. A shriek sends a shiver of fear up her spine as a car slams on the breaks, loses control and hits her good friend.

    Killers should be aware of the methods Survivors can use to locate them. Most Killers are very large, making them quite easy to see, but there are some other aspects to Survivor perception that are important to keep in mind:<br><br><b>Third Person View:</b> The Survivors have a wide third person perspective. The Survivor player is able to see behind their character and around corners.<br><br><b>Terror Radius:</b> Survivors hear a heartbeat when the Killer approaches. The closer the Killer is, the more intense the heartbeat.<br><br><b>The Stain:</b> Survivors can see an eerie red light emitted in front of the Killer. The stain can give away the Killer's position as well as the direction in which they are looking.<br><br><i>Consult</i> <i><b>"The Survivors"</b></i> <i>section of this guide to learn more about the Survivors' abilities.</i>

    The Huntress
    One of Kate Denson’s earliest memories was standing in front of her family, singing a song that she’d learned that morning at school, and watching smiles spread across their faces. Seeing how something as simple as a song could make people so happy was the moment when she knew what she wanted to do with her life.<br><br>She practised, learned the guitar as soon as she was big enough to reach over it, and was performing in front of crowds by the time she was eight years old. Her mother did everything she could to fulfil Kate’s dreams, taking her all over home state of Pennsylvania, then across the South, and even to Nashville itself.<br><br>Kate won folk music competitions and talent shows whenever she participated, but for her to win others had to lose, and that wasn’t in her nature. She only wanted an outlet, a way to touch people’s lives. To make them forget the worries of the world and just enjoy themselves, if only for a while.<br><br>With age came a new-found freedom. She bought a battered old Chevy truck and was able to travel around by herself, meeting fans and making new friends wherever she stopped. Hers wasn’t a story of rock excess though: just the road, her guitar and maybe a good bourbon to end the day.<br><br>From sun-baked festivals to dark and cosy bars, people flocked to her voice and her self-penned songs of friendship, family, love and home.<br><br>These sentiments weren’t just lip-service: she made sure to return home as often as she could, to help out in her community and entertain the local children with her tales of the wider world. She saw it as a way of giving back, of supporting others in the same way she had.<br><br>It was home where she found most of her inspiration as well. She had always loved to take long walks in the woods around her town, exploring off the beaten track, finding a quiet spot to play and write her songs. She had a favorite location she returned to time and again, a natural hollow, encircled by trees, that looked almost as if it had been blasted out of the rocks thousands of years ago.<br><br>Here she felt a strong connection to nature, and to the Earth itself. She let her mind be enveloped by the forest and it rewarded her with constant inspiration.<br><br>She picked up her guitar and played, her fingers dancing across the fretboard. The music that she made this time was unlike her usual uplifting tunes, being much more melancholy, even dark. Still, something compelled her to continue, to finish the song.<br><br>Around her, the leaves vibrated in unison with the guitar strings and the boughs of the trees lengthened, coalescing into a living form. Spider-like legs descended from the canopy above, grasping for her. Regaining her senses, she grabbed a rock and tried to beat them back, but their skin was as hard as iron and the rock simply bounced off and skittered away.<br><br>The legs coiled like tendrils around her limbs and lifted her towards the darkness overhead. Fog rolled across the clearing, obscuring both Kate and the creature of nightmares that drew her up towards itself.<br><br>When the fog cleared, there was no sign of any struggle, or of life. Just an acoustic guitar, the scratch plate engraved with flowers; as well as the initials KD, inlaid in mother of pearl.

    Jeffrey barrels through the crowd, keeping an eye on the moustached man and his index finger. He pushes a lady aside, strong arms a man. Move along, ya jerks. Everyone’s too disturbed by the acrobat’s death to be upset by a clown’s social faux pas. It’ll be days before it crosses anyone’s mind: Did that clown really elbow an old woman in the face? Jeffrey spots Moustache walking through the fair grounds. Tents, Ferris wheels, and food booths have gone dark, closed for the night. The scent of deep fryers and popcorn is still thick in the air.<br><br>Moustache breaks from the crowd. Perfect. Time to get to work. Jeffrey disappears into cover. Despite his size, despite his bright, gaudy clothing, he naturally slinks through the shadows. His anger over the raccoon infiltrating his garbage has fizzled away. There is only one creature of the night that lives here. His name is Jeffrey Hawk. 
    At first glance the endless bloodshed seems to be an act to satisfy some destructive instinct within The Entity. This seems to me a reductionist distortion of something more sophisticated, something more intricate, something even sacred. Beyond the horror, the shedding of blood and the very real appearance of death puts us in touch with life and can be an intoxicating and highly addictive experience on the deepest and most archaic levels. When our blood, or our life-force is offered to The Entity, it can be seen as a gift that is soon returned to us so that the horror may continue again and again. The world constantly churns with life and death, and death and life—the circulation of blood through an Old One from heart to body to kidney back to the heart again to be purified and begin anew.

    When he heard that Nancy’s mother had disappeared, Quentin Smith knew instantly that their success had been short-lived. Although their plan had seemed to work flawlessly, Freddy Krueger had beaten death yet again.<br><br>But Quentin wasn’t about to give up. It might take many attempts, but he vowed that somehow he would find a way to beat Freddy, once and for all. If he didn’t, it would only be a matter of time before Freddy would win and Nancy was lost.<br><br>Someone like Quentin never attracted attention in a library, no matter how strange the texts he requested were. He devoured all the information he could, on shared dream worlds, lucid dreaming, and the methods to control the dream space. Forcing himself to stay awake, via a steady diet of pills and energy drinks, he searched through dusty volumes, finding myths about the demons that live in dreams, trapping their victims in limbo and feeding off their terror. <br><br>He worked quickly as he knew that Freddy would soon be coming for him.<br><br>It wasn’t long before that moment arrived and Freddy began appearing in his dreams. He stayed at the periphery at first, taunting Quentin, seemingly hoping to tire him out. Using all that he had learned, Quentin was able to see flaws in the dream; cracks where escape routes could be formed. He tested this skill carefully, not wanting to show his hand, hoping that it would give him some kind of advantage that he could use to defeat Freddy. <br><br>Then, one night, he found himself in the familiar environment of Badham Preschool. Freddy had tired of the taunting and had finally decided to gut him.<br><br>Quentin ran through the school, his quick eyes scanning for something useful in the maze of rooms. He found a can of paint thinner and quickly formulated a plan. <br><br>Once the trap was set, he waited, acting as the lure to draw Freddy into the right position. And there he was, claws scraping on metal as he closed in for the kill. <br><br>Quentin allowed himself time to enjoy the surprise on Freddy’s face as the corridor ignited and then he was away, running through the building, heading for the exit that he knew existed. If he harried Freddy, weakening him and then escaping the dream to safety, surely that would defeat him over time?<br><br>Before his eyes, the cracks in the dream closed and his escape route was blocked. He was in Freddy’s secret room again, and there was nowhere to run.<br><br>As Freddy closed in, a broad grin spreading across his ruined face, Quentin was consumed by a need to see this man finally obliterated. He wished it had been him, not his father, who threw the gas can that ended Krueger’s life, that it had been him who cut Freddy’s throat. Perhaps that desire would be enough? This was a realm of the mind after all. <br><br>He let it consume him, concentrating all his thoughts on wishing Freddy gone.<br><br>His vision was obscured with roiling tendrils of fog and, when it cleared, he was somewhere else. In another dream? If so, it wasn’t his; it felt cold and unfamiliar.<br><br>A flickering drew his attention and he realized he was by a campfire, and he wasn’t alone. Other people were trapped here too, and they needed his help.

    Another incident woke me in the middle of the night. An incredible surge of energy coming to me from an undetermined source. At first, I thought my mind had given way to illusions and wild imaginings until I realized the energy surging through my tower was widening yet another doorway into a lost realm composed of memories from an unremembered civilization lost to time. I approached and stared into the remnants of a war-torn, abandoned city with the eerie cry of a baby echoing in the distance. Just as I made to enter the lost realm the scintillating doorway shrunk and sizzled out of existence. I soon realized it may very well be possible to explore this Old One from my tower with the help of this unique energy and the Auris.

Her dad says she's doing nothing wrong. He says Claudette's wired differently and that's okay. Her mom doesn't want her to collect plants and bugs anymore. Her dad says that's the best part of her and he doesn't need a child who fits some bell-curve. More than this he defends her. He tells her mother that the greatest treasures gifted to the world were from those who didn't conform. Who weren't normal. Who didn't fit some outdated bell-curve. Tolstoy. Tesla. Einstein. Shakespeare. Her mother doesn't care. A sudden cry escapes her lips. I don't want her to repeat the year.

    Chief screams his anger. Found bits and pieces of another deputy. Boy is picking them off like cattle in a barn yard. Chief swears to hell and beyond he'll make him pay. Make me pay? Me? You're the one who's gonna pay for letting me rot in that cell for all those years.  Chief calms down and calls someone. Tells them to bring the dogs. Bring them! Won't make a difference. No matter what he ain't ever going back to that cell or any other cell for that matter. He'll die a thousand deaths before they ever lock him up again. He wants to rush out of the darkness and grab him but something tells him that's exactly what Chief wants. He's trying to lure him with hurtful words. Boy sits in the shadows and stirs the dry leaves with one hand. He sees a deputy approaching with a flashlight. He grabs a thick branch and slowly rises and inches toward him. A hare springs in the air and bounds away. The deputy trains the flashlight on the rodent. He releases an anxious breath just as Boy swings the branch like Babe Ruth. Head and neck are smashed open and the dark contents splatter on the trees and ground. Yet the deputy doesn't fall. He stumbles here and there with his smashed head barely hanging by sinews of flesh, his hands desperately reaching out and feeling the cool, night air. Reminds Boy of a decapitated chicken fluttering about the yard searching for its head.  Boy smiles and feels liberated. He laughs to himself. Another deputy made clean. His Pa cleaned Chief's money now Boy cleans his deputies. Like father like son. He thinks of Chief and loses his smile. He could have helped him... all those years... he could have helped him.

    Adam was born in Rollington Town in Kingston, Jamaica. His father died in a car accident when he was two, and his uncle took him in. His uncle was a strict, but fair man, who raised him to value education.<br><br>At Kingston College, Adam discovered his father’s published works, which triggered his passion for literature. His campus, however, was known for its focus on athletics. As a shy teenager with his nose stuck in books, he was the perfect prey for bullies. What he lacked in sports, he made up in grit. He learned to defend himself in the thick of it.<br><br>It’s during his years in college that he started to imagine his life elsewhere. While his close friends orbited the music industry, he followed a surer path. His grades granted him admission to higher education, and there was a demand for teachers abroad.<br><br>After graduating university, he taught extra classes to afford applying fees overseas. He had a steady diet of long commutes, grading piles, nightly lesson plans, and early classes. After a year, he managed to apply for a position abroad. His first plane ride took him to Southern Japan for a new start.<br><br>His life in Kagoshima was hectic. There was little time to do everything he took for granted back home. His Japanese was elementary at best, which slowed him down. Buying groceries took hours, long commutes had to be planned, and lesson plans relied on Japanese notions, which he had to learn.<br><br>But after a few months, he found his rhythm. He reflected on it one morning while riding the train to work. He no longer had to study the kanji characters filling the map. He knew his way. His language skills had improved, he felt connected to his students, and he’d treat himself to luxurious restaurants on weekends. He even had his first vacation planned.<br><br>Within seconds, Adam’s world was brought down to a slow motion. Rails hissed, bags came pouring down, and the floor trembled before the hit: Adam crashed forward as the train flipped upside down. He landed on a window pane as an unhinged door came flying at a passenger. He rolled over so that the door would hit him instead of the girl. He shut his eyes as he braced for impact, but nothing happened.<br><br>He squinted one eye open and he saw nothing but darkness. A heavy Fog had taken over the train. Ice seemed to flow through his body, reaching his lips first, then the tip of his fingers before spreading to his legs. Lulled by the warm hum of the dark whisper, he closed his eyes, drifting.<br><br>No one truly knows what happened to Adam Francis. The school teachers imagined the worst when they watched the train derailment on the news and saw he was missing. Their fears seemed to be confirmed when Adam’s bag was recovered from the crash site, but his body was never found. To this day, his uncle believes that Adam took off after the train crash, alive still, somewhere out there.
    Lazar approaches Dwight and slams his desk. Max didn't work out. He was a weak male I just wanted to crush! Fear, anxiety, confusion—Dwight feels them all. How is this guy the CEO? More than that… he wanted to crush the employee he's replacing for being… for being… a weak male. Dwight doesn't even know what that means. Weak male? Who talks like that in this day and age? His hands fidget nervously. He swallows a growing lump in his throat. Lazar smashes his desk again. I need you to be bolder than him, Dwitch. I need you to get the buzz out there that we're the best company in the business. Did he just call me Dwitch? Dwitch? He just called me Dwitch. Dwight's still not sure what he's supposed to be doing at Peak 22. He's a Story-Hook Supervisor. He has no idea what that is.  Sounds convoluted and made up. Sounds like bullshit. He took the job because he needs the money and he can't dress up in costumes for birthday parties anymore. Kids can be so cruel. He's supposed to create fake profiles and write positive reviews about Lazar and his company. Lazar gives his desk another thump! Be a lion, Dwitch! Pounce on the internet! Pounce! Get the word out! Peak 22! We design Story-Hooks for ads that transcend humanity. Dwight has no idea what that means. Lazar leaves a test on his desk and walks away. Dwight stares at the test unsure. Rose, the manager who hired him, approaches him and explains it's an intelligence test. Lazar wants to make sure he's the smartest in his company. Best advice. Flunk it. Dwight smiles. Gotchya.

    Meg is the talk of the school and she likes it. Coach Jenny tells her she still needs a lot of work in the mechanics of running. She doesn’t even know what that means. She’s been running in the mountains with her mother for years and she never had to learn the ‘mechanics’ of running. Coach says for the next few practices she needs to improve her confidence on the starting line. Sure, that shouldn’t be a problem. Coach spends a lot of time with Meg and many on the team are beginning to take notice. Dana makes snide remarks in the shadows about Meg’s body being disproportional, about Meg having beginners’ luck, about how Meg’s legs seem disproportional to her torso.  Meg ignores her, refuses to dignify her jealousy by responding to it. Dana gets no reaction from Meg as she talks about how her thighs are just a bit too thick for running. Dana gives her that stupid, gas face. Meg glares at Dana with a flood of expletives she wants to unleash. You’ll eat my dust soon enough, wench! Meg suppresses her anger and smiles politely, thanking the wench for her concern, telling her she’s confident her so-called disproportional body and thick thighs will prove advantageous at the championship.

    I am going through some past scribblings and the notes of the previous unknown occupants, and I realize I should at least try to organize them. Reading these notes, I decipher several voices who I am aptly calling the unknown few who like myself had a fixation with the Entity and who like myself had an ability to experience the memories encoded in the fog. I will include my past scribblings and number them as best as I can, referring to them as notes obscura, or just obscura, to try and piece together how long I've actually been here. I think I may have found my first ramblings amongst the half-destroyed journals of the unknown occupants who struggled with infinite possibilities of whiling away the time except the one they probably missed the most. The one I miss the most—friendship, companionship, sitting with my father drinking whiskey and watching the Ancients swim across the night sky, or just losing time with a friend in a hearty conversation about the merits of art, music, laughter and stories. All I have now are the memories of others. Second-hand experiences that constantly remind me of things lost and half-remembered.

    Players are graded based on their performance during the trials. Grade progression between Killers and Survivors are separate—your grade as a Killer will not affect your grade as a Survivor or vice-versa.<br><br>The grading system features five grades, each with four classes:<br><li><b>Ash</b>: IV, III, II, I</li><li><b>Bronze</b>: IV, III, II, I</li><li><b>Silver</b>: IV, III, II, I</li><li><b>Gold</b>: IV, III, II, I</li><li><b>Iridescent</b>: IV, III, II, I</li><br><br>All players start at Ash IV. At the end of each trial, you are awarded pips based on your performance. Earning enough pips increases your class. For example, if you were in Ash IV, you would move up to Ash III.<br><br>If you are at the top of your grade you would move to the next grade. For example, if you were in Silver I, you would move up to Gold IV.<br><br>Grades are reset on the 13th of every month. Bloodpoints are awarded based on the highest grade you have achieved during the month.<br><br><b>NOTE:</b> Custom games are unranked and will not affect grades.

    Dawn bleeds across the craters and trenches and into the devastated forest. Explosions tear the ground. Mud rises and showers Anna. Men tumble headlong into open craters filled with rotting cadavers. Mangled human and horse flesh make a feast for rats. Other men are blasted to bits and pieces. Some drown in mud and blood. The brutal savagery of these human animals amuses Anna. She's never been so entertained. They are worse than hungry wolves fighting over a carcass. Some speak words she understands. Others speak words foreign to her ears. A pathetic scream like nothing she's heard suddenly startles her. She follows the source of the sound into the decimated forest where she sees a small canvas tent and Russian soldiers  guarding foreign prisoners. She watches them all evening. She watches horrified when they execute one of the horses for dinner. So much meat wasted due to sloppy butchery. After dinner the Russians grab one of their foreign prisoners and crush his head with a shovel to pass the time. They laugh and make jokes. She watches them in the shadows and laughs silently. Not with them. At them. A shovel is clunky. The blows are awkward. The death… messy.  These men are neither fish nor meat. Her mother taught her better.

    Facing The Deathslinger
    Mikaela Reid was sixteen when her father passed away. She would always miss his sailing lessons at dawn, his colorful yet inedible tacos, and his warm, contagious laughter. She felt like she was paddling in a vast storm-black ocean, each rolling wave submerging her. Drifting in painful darkness, she almost lost herself, but resiliently, with love and care, she made her way back to shore. <br><br> Well-surrounded and supported by her friends, Mikaela put the past behind her and looked at life in a new light. She was excited to try new things and discovered storytelling as an outlet. Her friends liked her stories of daunting danger and hard-earned survival.  She read horror stories more and more, savoring the powerful, heart-pounding escapism it provided. Autumn became her favorite season and she threw a grand production for Halloween every year, hosting all her friends for a thrilling night of horror stories, scary games, and homemade treats. <br><br> Over the years, she also showed interest in witchcraft and practiced light blessings, plant-based spells, and palm-reading divination. She gardened sage, mugwort, and lavender to craft homemade products such as body butters, soaps and skin lotions. She aspired one day to live off the products she made for friends and family. <br><br> In the meantime, she worked as a barista at the Moonstone, an independent and eccentric coffee shop in the artsy part of town. Every Friday night, she hosted an open mic at the coffee shop, performing stories live in front of customers. Julian, her best friend and roommate, recorded some of her shows and posted them online. Also, unbeknown to her, he submitted one of her performances to the Endless Halloween Festival where renown storytellers performed on stage for Halloween. <br><br> It was a beautiful surprise when Mikaela received an email from the festival inviting her to perform at their grand final on Halloween. The winning prize was big enough for her to launch her line of products. Excited, she burnt a stick of herbs in each room to dissipate negative energies, then began to craft her tale of horror. <br><br> Mikaela stayed up all night filling her notebooks with abandoned beginnings. She had a story in mind, but unearthing it took patience and skill. The following night, the nightmares began. For a week, she would wake in the middle of the night gasping for air. Her dream was the same every night.  She was dragged down a cold set of stairs and thrown into a dark basement. Then her lungs would be set ablaze by a sharp iron hook stabbing her in the chest. A dark figure would pull on the hook and hoist her from the ground, slowly, until the pain waked her. The more she finessed her Halloween tale, the darker her nightmares grew. <br><br> As days passed, exhaustion, anxiety, and stress took a toll on her. Often distracted, her coffees at the Moonstone were rushed, acrid, or going to the wrong customer. She no longer blessed the coffee beans in the morning nor looked for omens in the leftover coffee grains. Her energy was low, and her magic felt drained. <br><br> When she woke up screaming one night, she had had enough. She asked Julian to watch her while she slept and record anything unusual. Julian agreed and started recording while Mikaela lay on her bed. <br><br> Minutes later, her fingers began to twitch, then her toes. Her breath became labored. Then Julian stared in shock as Mikaela slowly rose in the air, levitating over her bed. Panicked, he shook her shoulders to wake her, but stopped when she began to scream. He grabbed his phone to call an ambulance, but a powerful crash diverted his attention. He looked down the hallway and saw a large, spidery fang slam through the bathroom door. <br><br> Amidst the commotion, Mikaela awoke. She saw the black spidery fang shredding the bathroom door and jumped out of bed. She slammed her bedroom door shut and shouted at Julian to help her barricade the door. Before he could react, however, the power went out. The room was submerged in sudden darkness. <br><br> A second later, the lights came back on and an eerie quietness followed. Mikaela and Julian ventured out the bedroom carefully. The bathroom door looked intact and there was no sign of anything abnormal. But Julian had recorded every sound. <br><br> A sleepless night followed. When she returned to the apartment after her shift, Julian was not there. Mikaela wanted him to remove the recording of their ordeal, which he had posted online. Suspecting Julian might be at school, she left. The door clicked shut behind her, masking a stifled cry from the bathroom. <br><br> As she neared her car, she looked over her shoulder. Mikaela felt... watched. She whispered a protective spell and clutched her keys. Suddenly, a shadow pounced on the wall and she broke into a run. She reached her car and rushed inside, locking the doors. Breathing hard, she looked through the windows. No one was there. Perhaps it was her nerves playing tricks on her. She turned on the ignition and drove off. <br><br> The next day, Julian was still nowhere to be found. Mikaela had contacted everyone she knew. She looked for him all day and waited for him all night. Distraught and anxious, she missed her shift at the Moonstone.  Halloween was tonight and so was the festival. Julian had entered the storytelling competition for her. He had supported her every time she doubted herself. Maybe he would be there. But between her nightmares and Julian's disappearance, she had been too worried to prepare a story for the contest. She looked at her notebook, filled with false starts. She could stay home, scared and sleepless. Or she could finish what Julian had started. There was a reason why she loved to tell horror stories. They made her feel brave enough to face any challenge. <br><br>That evening when the host called Mikaela's name at the Endless Halloween Festival, she boldly stepped on stage, dressed in costume: a black dress matched with a wide, witchy hat. She hoped to spot Julian in the crowd. But she could not find him and looking directly at the audience was a mistake.  A sea of expectant faces was before her, eyes watching her every move. Her heart pounded in her chest as her hands began to shake. <br><br> She grabbed the warm microphone and cleared her throat. A thick silence greeted her, only interrupted by a distant cough. She reminded herself that tonight was All Hallows' Eve, when the veil thinned betwixt this realm and the one beyond. She had a story in her heart, a story that mattered. If she told it right, perhaps Julian would hear it. <br><br> Mikaela took a deep breath. The wet wind of Autumn whirled golden leaves around her. She inhaled the acrid smell of damp, foliage. She swallowed the bitter aftertaste of coffee still on her tongue. Distant crows cawed from an old oak tree. She closed her eyes. The crimson darkness under her eyelids turned darker. Her heartbeat slowed. She exhaled deeply, her breath a puff of mist in the cold night air. Now she felt awakened, refreshed for the first time in weeks, and ready to tell the tale of a lifetime. <br><br>She spoke into the microphone in a deep, haunting voice. She narrated a tale of billowing winds on a cold Autumn night. Of a loyal friend disappearing before daylight. Of forgotten victims hiding in the wings of darkness. Of throbbing graves, sealed with terrible secrets. And of eternal night in the shadow of death. <br><br>Mikaela pointed at the night sky and said that no darkness was truly beyond light. Even on this moonless night, the sky shined with long-dead stars. <br><br> A thick black fog engulfed Mikaela, to the audience's amazement. <br><br> And no one saw Mikaela Reid again.

    From a window I see something moving with an uncanny light. Through the black fog it shines there, beckoning me. And yet, I cannot leave. I cannot move. I can only bring things to me through the Auris.  What light is this? Is it a creature sent by the Entity? Is it a survivor? Or perhaps it’s a marooned soul from back home searching like myself for a way back. An unnatural wind whines and I stare at the moving, hypnotic light, a hideous watching eye, trying to reach out to me, trying to tell me something, trying to convey something in its strange, rhythmic movement.

    Though Adiris' movements are met with pain, she lifts her head to the sky, thanking the gods for their guidance. Their whisper remains, further away, dissipating, yet still commanding, influencing. She opens her heart, allows the whisper to seize her body. She strides to the quarters of the Maiden's Guard and takes a uniform, confident no one will discover the violation, knowing the gods are on her side. A censer of sweet frankincense sits atop a table, compelling her to it. She allows her hands to move as they will, filling the censer with oil and glowing embers. She does not question the will of the gods, knowing all threads shall be woven and someday the tapestry complete. Trust in them, Adiris!<br><br>She steps into the moonlight. Nightfall. Smoke dances around her body. Bare feet carry her along a stone path to the mouth of the temple. As she peers inside, she sees through the shadows to the slight, shivering figure of the high priest Haban—the mentor, the father, the blasphemer.<br><br>May his voice reach the beyond.

He holds his flute, going over the notes to the song he wrote.<br><br>He shuffles to the front of the class, places his sweaty fingers on the instrument. Following a deep, unsteady breath, he gently blows out a wisp of air, creating a light, whimsical sound. He closes his eyes, moves his fingers precisely, playfully dancing over each note. He ignores the squeaks of the hamster. The flute's sound carries like chimes in the wind. With one final soul-piercing note, he smiles and opens his eyes. His classmates are huddled around the rodent, laughing with its every move. His teacher too.<br><br>He walks to the group. Students pass the hamster around as it squeaks incessantly. It finds itself directed into Ji-Woon's palm. He takes it in both hands. With one steady movement, he squeezes. A squeal. A slight crunch. No more sound. The children scream. Ji-Woon feels nothing.

More grisly and macabre, sure, but just another lunatic with a penchant for the over-dramatic, who would soon be behind bars.<br><br>A stroke of insight brought Tapp, and his partner Detective Stephen Sing, to an abandoned mannequin factory, where they discovered Jigsaw’s lair. They apprehended the man but he managed to escape before being unmasked, slashing Tapp’s throat as he did so.<br><br>Leaving his partner, Sing went in pursuit, but fell victim to a booby trap.<br><br>Tapp had failed to go by the book on this one occasion, entering the lair without a warrant, and it had resulted in a Detective’s death. He was discharged from the force and left with a ruined throat and crippling guilt.<br><br>He channeled that guilt into an obsession: he would find the Killer, stop the murders, vindicate himself, and avenge his friend and colleague. Following the evidence trail brought him to Dr Lawrence Gordon and he staked out the doctor’s apartment, sure that he would find some evidence of guilt.<br><br>Then he saw a stranger at Gordon’s window, and heard gunshots. Tapp confronted him and the man fled, with the pursuit leading to an industrial building.<br><br>Tapp’s age caught up with him, A fight that he would easily have won in his younger days ended with Tapp taking a bullet to the chest. Slumping to the floor, he saw only failure. He had failed his partner, and the other victims. Whoever the Killer was, Tapp had been unable to stop him. More would die and it would be his fault.<br><br>He let the rage and guilt consume him and closed his eyes for the final time. Beneath him, the concrete floor softened. He dug his fingers into the ground, feeling dirt and leaves. Where his chest had been wet with blood, the shirt was now dry and the pain had gone. His eyes opened onto a darkened sky and the jagged, searching fingers of branches.<br><br>Screams echoed through the forest and a new determination filled him. His mind was clear for the first time in months. Victims needed to be avenged, Killers thwarted. He didn’t know what this place was, but he was still a cop, and he always would be. He had a job to do.

When I was done they began to talk and argue and bicker with each other over pedestrian nonsense.

    Born into a lush Parisian household, Élodie Rakoto grew up in a comfortable home miles away from the verdant island of Madagascar, her parents' birthplace. Her backpack was always heavy and usually contained no schoolwork. She carried the essentials: a few history books, some printed maps, and a compact shovel. Instead of wasting away with regurgitated facts from her classes, she explored the city to discover the stories behind each statue, neighborhood, and street sign. She collected bits and pieces of Paris, making it her own.<br><br>When she was fourteen, her parents took her to Dyer Island for a 'business trip.' To her grand disappointment, the island was a private site for exclusive members of the Imperiatti. She was forced to attend pretentious and awkward social mixers daily.  After a few weeks on the island, she met the Pariahs, like-minded teenagers who had no interest in being pawns for their parents' political chessboard. On dull, rainy nights she would convince them to sneak out and explore the island unsupervised.<br><br>One foggy evening, they stumbled upon an abandoned internment camp. Felix, one of the Pariahs, didn’t want to go in, but Élodie insisted. Inside, they found a strange underground laboratory in ruins. The Pariahs grew excited, browsing through the strange apparatuses for trophies and mementos. But Élodie noticed something in the far-left corner of the wall: odd scratches in the shape of a circle. She ran her fingernails against the cool concrete—the marks were deep and narrow. A warm whisper suddenly sent her mind adrift—<br><br>—Deep, rumbling thunder. Black, glistening waves. An ashen sanded beach. Incomplete. She was compelled to touch the ice-cold sand and draw a circle with a line in the middle.<br><br>A sharp thunderclap and lightning whipped the sky. The ground shook as sleek, obsidian claws tore through the concrete floor, ripping the earth open. The building began to collapse and Élodie spotted her mother wielding a bizarre instrument while her father told her to run. Then--<br><br>Complete darkness.<br><br>Élodie never saw her parents again.<br><br>For years, this nightmare woke her in the middle of the night, cold, sweating, shaking like a leaf. As a child she suffered from night terrors and often resisted going to bed. To soothe her mind, her grandma would light a tea candle and tell her stories until the wick extinguished in a hot pool of liquified wax. The perfume of the warm vanilla-scented wax would lull Élodie to sleep as she envisioned stories of legendary heroes defeating fear and foes. Élodie had forgotten the stories, but she still remembered her longing for the verdant Malagasy rainforests and colossal mountains that her grandmother described. When Élodie felt cold and numb with grief, she would light a vanilla-scented candle and summon her childhood memories of this distant, idyllic place, raising her spirits to rise above her crippling depression.<br><br>Fourteen years later, Élodie still searched for the missing pieces of the puzzle. No rational explanation could explain her parents' disappearance, so she had been looking elsewhere. She researched any and all legends that mentioned a dark force that snatched people at night without a trace. From there, she translated old tales and built a tapestry of narratives from around the world that corroborated the uncanny way her parents had vanished on Dyer's island. She also gathered artifacts made by ancient civilizations who sought to destroy or resurrect the incomprehensible and indescribable Thing that took her parents. There were various names for it, differing from one language to the next: The Abyss, The Infinite, The Hole.<br><br>Her findings pushed her further into the dark field of occultism. The Pariahs were long gone. She'd alienated them with her theories. But she refused to give up on her parents.<br><br>Élodie set out into the cold, misty evening. She turned a corner, leaving Paris' 13th arrondissement, an eccentric neighborhood with a substantial library dating from the middle ages. She had pressing work to do for Hazra Shah, the Collector, an occult specialist who archived rare artifacts.<br><br>He’d recruited her after she’d salvaged a rare stolen Maori statue of spidery fangs like the claws she'd seen on Dyer's island. For the next five years, Élodie had been procuring occult relics for the Collector. In exchange, he provided large sums of money, equipment, and precise information about obscure manuscripts.<br><br>Just as the Collector requested, she had secured the annals of a witch trial convicting a mother birthing conjoined twins in the 17th century. According to legend, an occult incantation was engraved on a set of skulls, all of which the Collector possessed except one—the witch's skull. There were no traces of where the skull was now, but Élodie had found a newspaper article dating back to the same year, mentioning that most remains had been relocated to the catacombs to avoid a pandemic. Élodie was acting on a hunch. Breaking into the catacombs to retrieve a lost skull involved certain risks, but no more than the previous work she'd done for the Collector.<br><br>With a flashlight, she followed the ancient layout of the catacombs and spotted a collapsed wall. A few large stones blocked the way in. She grabbed her portable XRF analyzer and scanned the materials of the wall. Working for the Collector had its perks. The brick mortar had been poorly mixed, showing high traces of sand. The whole thing was brittle, and the ground was moist from the damp evening air. This was her way in.<br><br>The journey beneath was long and treacherous. The air was heavy and moldy. She gasped when her key-chain flashlight hit an endless wall of bleached-white skulls.<br><br>Something cracked behind her. She spun around and collided headfirst with a baseball bat. Pain exploded in her skull and darkness filled her view.<br><br>When she came to, a man was carrying her over his shoulder, venturing deeper inside the catacombs. He was wearing a dark robe.<br><br>The Black Vale.<br><br>She'd managed to elude them until now. Ruthless and lethal, they went by many names. She'd figured out that they ultimately all worked for the same group, a ring of occult fanatics rumored to perform human sacrifices for what they called The Old One. She had to get out of here fast.<br><br>Élodie spotted a loose skull on the wall, grabbed it and smashed it on her assaulter's head. Stunned, the man lost his balance and Élodie hit the ground running. As she turned a corner, she suddenly felt a sharp pain to her side.<br><br>She looked down and saw a large blade planted there. Shocked, she removed the knife and warm blood spurted out.<br><br>Her heartbeat rang in her ears as her vision blurred.<br><br>She fell to her knees. Summoning all her strength, she drew a circle on the ground with a shaking, blood-red finger and traced a line in the middle.<br><br>An opaque heaviness fell over her shoulders. A familiar scent of vanilla-spiked fruits and lychee nuts coated the air. Thin, tropical rain drizzled down leafy vines. Warmth.<br><br>Madagascar.<br><br>A ghostly cry erupted from the thick foliage.<br><br>Élodie looked up and the vines turned into hissing snakes. The soft canopy soil suddenly turned ashen and collapsed under her feet. She sank into something dense and cold that swallowed her like quicksand. She screamed, before being smothered by... the abyss...the infinite... the hole...<br><br>She found what she had been searching for.

    She was going to search for another pack of human animals but something catches her eye. Something that reminds her of her father. Something perfect for her little bushka. A gift. Anna hides in the shadows and fixes her gaze on the gift. The Russian soldier carves the gift as he guards and swears at foreign prisoners in the shredded canvas tent. They kill and torture each other because they cannot talk to one another. She remembers a book her mother once had. She pointed to the pictures and called them soldiers. They were the ones who butchered her father. Soldiers tear each other apart for reasons her mother could never explain. She watches them and doesn't understand.  She's not sure they do either. Maybe they like the hunt, the scent of fear, the bloodlust. She stares at the perfect gift and wants to give them a little war they'll never forget. But there are too many and her mother suddenly appears before her with a smile and tells her little Anna she will need to thin the ranks. I can do that. I will show you. I will show you, and I will show them… where crawfish sleep.

    Onna Shibaraku
    Overbeck staggers out of his house with a canvas bag still trying to process the last few hours of his life. Everything's a blur, nothing makes sense, and his veins are still pumping with a tingling concoction of anesthesia and adrenalin. Feels like Nam all over again. One minute you're drifting off to some faraway dreamland, the next you're fighting off the surgeon in a strange, foggy, half-nightmare. He remembers seeing the nurse, twitching, convulsing, changing. Changing into something he didn't quite understand and still doesn't even though they're everywhere. He remembers sensing something was off. Way off. He remembers his gut churning, twisting, fighting against the weight of his eyelids, trying his best to keep them open as bloody hell erupted all around him. He remembers falling to the ground with the nurse, the tray clattering, the knives and tools scattering. He wanted to sleep, just sleep, but he ordered his eyes to stay open and spotted the syringe rolling over the antiseptic floor. He remembers jerking his arm out, grabbing the syringe and smashing it into his heart. Or was it his arm? Or maybe both? He doesn't remember anymore. Doesn't matter. All that matters is he made it out of that hell alive. He shakes his throbbing head and clambers over a barricade blocking an alley. Winds his way through the burning city toward the market. Most of the city has been reduced to shit. Smoke and fumes seep through the streets. The air reeks of burning civilization. Burning humanity. He recognizes the smell. Brings him back to places he'd rather forget. Emergency sirens keen endlessly over the echoing shrieks of the infected. Flames erupt from the ruins and barricades making Philly look like a smoldering wasteland of death and destruction. He had read articles about the so-called green flu. It had only been a few days and it already felt like it was bringing us all back to the goddamn Stone Age. This is worse than Nam. Way worse. Philly in chaos and overrun by the infected. It was more than a common flu. No kidding. Dozens of conspiracy theories and now it doesn't matter. It just doesn't matter. All that matters is surviving. Been here before. Many times. He hears someone shout out a curse and spots a young woman clobbering an infected hoard by the market entrance with a rake. Impressive. Up and at em, soldier! Mind if I cut in. They slash through the infected until all that's left is writhing flesh and gore. He stares at her. She approaches him. Not bad, old man. Name's Zoey, last woman on Earth. Not really but it feels like it. She laughs and wipes chunks of putrid flesh off her arm. She reminds him of a kid he knew in Nam. Strong smile and beaucoup funny… beaucoup fierce… just like her.

    In the darkness of his cell he hears footsteps approaching. He hears laughter and gossip. His father with others. He's not sure who he's with. He puts his ear to the door and hears a laugh, a deep guttural laugh. He feels his skin crawl and his stomach twist in knots. It can only be Chief.  He hates Chief especially when he's with his Pa. They make him do all kinds of things for fun and laughs. His Pa brags about his killing tool as he often calls him. More laughter. Other voices. Chief brought some deputies to enjoy the show. He wants to smash them all to bits just to make them stop laughing. Everyone laughs at him. The whole world laughs at him. He grinds his teeth with frustration. They ain't supposed to laugh. They're supposed to protect him and he knows it. He's seen it on his TV, the only thing that calms him and keeps him company when he's done his work. TV is something special... the friend and parent he never had... But Chief... Chief ain't like those on TV.  
He's another kind of Chief of police.  The kind that works with Pa to clean money. He doesn't even know what that means but he overheard them by the pigpen talking about cleaning a whole load of money and sharing that load with a judge and other men of the law.  They clean money together. That's why Chief lets Pa and Ma do whatever they want to him. Chief is crooked his Pa always says. Crooked like his boy's face. The laughter grows louder. They approach his brick dungeon and he shivers at the thought of more slaughter. He's tired of killing to make a few deputies laugh. Real tired.  He feels his blood boiling, feels it rising through his neck, feels it pushing up his face like it wants to burst through his skull. A sudden high-pitching whistling noise fills his ears. He hits his head over and over again until the whining stops.  Silence returns, for a moment, just a moment, and then a chain rattles. Bolts snap loudly as he loses balance and falls back to his haunches. The door opens filling his brick cell with blinding sunlight. He covers his eyes with his arm. His Pa steps inside, grabs him, and yanks him to his feet. Come on, Boy! Let's show these deputies your worth!

    The son of wealthy landowners Max and Evelyn Thompson, this unnamed boy was an unwanted child born to savage parents. Hideously disfigured, he was shut away from society. So ashamed they were of their son, they bricked him into a room and fed him through a hole in the wall. When the boy escaped, he took his revenge savagely and terribly, slaughtering the parents who had tortured him instead of raising him.<br><br>After the deed was done, he continued to live his life at the farm, taking out his deranged violence on the animals that were allowed to run free. As he finally broke free from his shackles, he ran through the cornfields, chasing and slaughtering whatever he could find. They never found the bodies of Max and Evelyn, but they did find tortured and disemboweled animals, all over the farm. Coldwind Farm was quickly settled and the land split up and sold off. There was never a buyer for the farmhouse. Perhaps because of that sound of a chainsaw you could hear throughout those hot summer nights.<br>

    Jane shares a beer with her friend Dwayne. Dwayne tells her how a creative executive hired him to be the co-writer of his terrible script. To be the spokesperson of his terrible idea. To validate his insensitive cultural appropriation of an African American story. The creative executive wants to make a minority film because it’s a fad. The quickest way to be recognized. The fast track to fame for a hack. Many writers told the hack his script was wrong on so many levels. Badly written. Disrespectful. Boring. Insensitive. Dwayne refused to accept a script that was disrespectful to his cultural heritage. Refused to attach his name to a project so the executive could avoid accusations of cultural appropriation. Refused to validate an entitled interpretation of a minority story. The executive discredited Dwayne by calling him a social justice warrior. Fired him. Jane sighs sadly for her friend. At least the script won’t get produced. Dwayne raises a skeptical eyebrow. The hack has a friend with money. Lots of money. He’ll write. Direct. And produce. Entitled hacks with friends in high places. It’s how bad movies get made. They toast bad movies. Jane laughs. Not because it’s funny. Because it’s true.

But he senses that to know… to really know would drive him… mad. Madness. That's what this place is. The embodiment of madness. He doesn't want to be pulled into another trial. He wants to return home. He must return home. That's why he was studying the serum. It gave him insight. Insight to what? He doesn't remember.

    Wolves growl and lunge and rip pieces of flesh off the dangling carcass. Jake holds the cord tightly with one hand as he uses the other hand to attack the wolves with a branch. He’s exhausted and doesn’t know what to do. He feels like a tick beaten and battered by the rain... broken... beaten... defeated... Not by the hunt, or the wolves but the thoughts and emotions swarming in his head like a hive of anxious bees.  

The wolves circle the tree with cackles and growls that seem like laughter in the night. How the hell did I end up here? Up a tree fighting wolves in the middle of nowhere! And how the hell am I gonna get down? He hears his brother’s voice break through the din below.  

The stupid shit we do when we’re lost and alone, right bro?  

Jake swallows a growing lump in his throat and admits the truth for the first time in years. You’ve always seen right through me, little bro. God, I miss you. But you’re right... I am lost and I am alone... and I have no idea who I am or what I want to do with my life... and that fortune-teller was right... I didn’t know what to choose... so I chose nothing.  

His mother’s voice returns. No, Jake. He was wrong. You did choose something.  

Jake draws a deep shuddering breath and closes his eyes, remembering his first birthday as his mother had described it so many times.  

He’s dressed in his first red and blue Hanbok, sitting on a white blanket with all kinds of objects spread before him. Pens. Rice. Paint. Ink. Brushes. Money. His aunts, uncles and cousins encourage him to choose something with exaggerated baby-talk.  

The fortune-teller asks everyone to be quiet and says the object Jake picks first will be the driving motivation of his life. The birthday boy drags himself toward the objects… drags himself past the pen… past the rice and the cake… past the ink and the brushes… nothing seems to interest him. But then—

He spots something. His eyes go wide with excitement, and he charges toward—

The money!  

Yells! Screams! More baby-talk to encourage him to take the money! But— 

Jake doesn’t take the money. He doesn’t even look at it. He surprises everyone by charging past the money with perfect focus and he only stops when he reaches a man kneeling in prayer. One-year-old Jake looks up at his father, smiles, and grabs his finger. His father smiles back at him, and his mother takes a picture— 

The picture.  

Jake opens his eyes and now he hears his mother’s voice above the snapping and snarling wolves. The fortune-teller didn’t really know what to tell us. He said we didn’t arrange the objects properly. He said you chose nothing. But I think we both know he was wrong.   

I don’t understand... 

It’s been years, Jake. Finish the letter. Teach him about his father. And come back home.   

I wouldn’t know what to write... what to say... 

You’ll figure it out. Just remember that he respects what you did because in the end he knows…  

You chose family.  

You always did, and you always will. That’s why I know you’ll do what needs to be done. Come back… help him complete his story.  

The imaginary words strike Jake’s heart like lightning. His eyes widen with sudden understanding, and for the first time in his life he wonders... he wonders what it would have been like to grow up without a father. To miss all the things his father gave him. To miss all the things he took for granted... 

Hiking. Fishing. Hunting. Camping. Fun and fierce games of Baduk in moonlit tents. It wasn’t all superficial bullshit. There was good, too. A lot of good.  

He was so contradictory.  

Aren’t we all. 

I suppose we are.  

Jake loosens his grip on the cord and stares at the frenzied wolves below, and for the first time in his life, he knows exactly what he needs to do.

    It’s been months she hasn’t worked. No calls. No auditions. Nothing. Jane stares at the blank television screen. As a child she used to imagine herself on television. She doesn’t see herself on television anymore. Something is happening. She can’t see herself succeeding anymore. She wishes for her shot. Her one shot. Her one in a billion shot. But scripts for her are few and far between. Nothing beyond the stereotype. Her agent shouldn’t care. He should put her forward for all the female roles in her age range. She can play any female role, lead or support and yet she only gets auditions for the Spicy Latina or the funny immigrant or the waitress with the accent, never just… woman… American. That’s all she wants. She stares at the snowy television. Tries to visualize herself as the star of a show but can’t. The phone rings. Her agent. An audition. A major part in a play and it pays well.  For a moment, just a moment, she feels like one in a billion.

    Oblivious
    Even while he lived, Freddy Krueger was a creature of nightmare for those who truly knew him. Hiding behind a mask of warmth and friendliness, Freddy's actual temperament was known only to his victims. When those victims were finally heard, the parents of Springwood tracked Freddy down and took the law into their own hands. They thought fire had rid them of a monster that night, that their children were finally safe, but evil as strong as his has a way of surviving.<br><br>Years passed, the horror was buried, the victims mercifully forgot. Then, somehow, Freddy returned, and dreams became nightmares once again.<br><br>Freddy focused his anger on those he felt had wronged him, building up to his one true obsession: Nancy Holbrook. But he underestimated her strength and resourcefulness. Together with her friend, Quentin, she managed to weaken Freddy, mutilating him and leaving him for dead once more.<br><br>Death didn't want Freddy the first time he encountered it, why did they think it would take him now? He emerged once more, consumed with vengeance. Then he turned his sights on the boy who had blocked his path to Nancy, his number one. <br><br>Freddy invaded Quentin's dreams, terrorizing him night after night, until his strength and defenses would be at their lowest. When the time was right, he forced the boy to return to the dark reflection of Badham Preschool. Here he would have his final revenge.<br><br>Freddy stalked the boy through the school's halls. He took his time, savoring every moment of the hunt. This was what he enjoyed the most: the smell of their sweat in the air, the ragged gasps of their terrified breath. They were his to play with. <br><br>There was the boy, at the end of a long corridor. Too tired and scared to run anymore? Resigned to his fate? Freddy closed in, arms wide, claws raking the wall. Their tips traced along a pipe, the metallic shrieking only adding to the boy’s apprehension.<br><br>A shower of sparks rained on the ground, and into the liquid that covered the tiled floor. A blue flame blossomed and quickly engulfed the room.<br><br>The boy took flight as Freddy burst from the flames in a fury. Rooms and walls raced past in a blur until they were in Freddy's basement. There would be no escape from here.<br><br>Slowly Freddy closed in on the boy. His fear was so strong now that Freddy could almost taste it, but his eyes burned with a defiant hatred that was almost admirable. <br><br>Freddy drew back his claws.<br><br>Then Freddy felt another presence with him; something old, powerful and dark. A miasma enveloped him and the only sensation was a sound like wooden beams flexing and creaking in the distance. The echoing groan of metal crushed against metal. Something arcane and unknowable, half-way between language and pure terror. <br><br>There was a moment of falling and spinning, and then Freddy was back in the school. But not his school. It looked the same, but it felt different. His powers were tempered in some ways and focused in others. The boy had gone for now, but other prey walked the hallways. Some would be inconsequential; others would become his new favorites. All would fall before his claws.

It is a nightmare of unrestrained, feral rage as it hunts down its prey and rips it to pieces, devouring every last morsel of flesh and gore, leaving nothing for scavengers. The creature is untouched by any sense of compassion or restraint. Looming over its victim, it shows no doubt or mercy, just the pure instinct of its insatiable bloodlust as it delivers the deathblow. A perfect hunter, The Demogorgon is a macabre testament to the horrors lurking in the Upside Down and why it was choice pickings for The Entity.

    Chamber of Blood. Harbinger of Hell. Evil Eyes. 1.<br><br>Haddie Kaur lifted her chai tea, let the steaming, spicy cardamom and cinnamon elixir sooth down her throat, and set down her stainless-steel cup in the small dhaba near her ancestral village of Mohi. The tea warmed her insides, yet she shivered cold with a nameless terror that mocked and poked at her like a formless apparition, reminding her that all wasn't what it seemed and that there were nameless things that went bump in the night. 

Ever since Haddie could remember she had seen and heard things beyond the veil, and she even had vague recollections of the day her parents disappeared while they were vacationing when she was five years old. She remembered the whispers, the approaching darkness, and the sense that somehow they were in another reality. She didn't remember much about that time, but she remembered being taken in by her French-Canadian godparents, the Rois, who raised her with their son, Jordan. 

Now Haddie and her older stepbrother Jordan were in India, filming episodes for their fairly successful web series 'Harbinger of Hell' with their uncle Stefan. A fan had sought them out after having watched one of their episodes about interdimensional overlaps which Haddie could sense, feel and even explore if her focus was right and she was able to 'tune in' as she so often described her process.  

As their luck would have it this mysterious benefactor had funded an entire expedition all over the world, giving her brother and uncle access to countless remote and classified areas of known paranormal activity and unexplainable disappearances. 

Haddie sipped her tea, listening to the villagers speak a language that reminded her of her disappeared father, and she suddenly heard a familiar voice and Quebecois accent that stood out from the rest calling out her name.  

A moment later Stefan entered the dhaba with Jordan. “I found the site of the massacre,” Stefan said. “Finish your tea, and let's get outta here!”  

Haddie sprang to her feet and followed her uncle and brother into the scorching hot day.

    Dark Cloak
    A single-edged straight sword handed down from generation to generation. The blade shattered after spilling the blood of her kin.
    Jake sits high in a tree with the hog dangling from a cord. He grips the cord tightly and hopes the branch he’s uses as support doesn’t give way. Another howl rents the night and the chirping insects go silent. The wolves are coming, and they want what’s rightfully his. He’s glad he ate, and he feels new life coursing through his veins. He feels his focus sharpening, and yet he still hears his mother. 

You should have finished the letter when you had a chance.  

I’ll finish it another time.  

If you get ‘another time’ Jake.  

I will.  

And what If you die here? What if you go missing? Your father will sell everything just to find you.  

Yeah, right. All he cares about is his packaging empire.   

You really don’t know your father if that’s what you think… or why he carries that picture with him everywhere he goes. 

Jake scoffs. The picture means nothing! Even the fortune-teller didn’t know what it meant.  

But it means something to him, Jake. It means the world to him. You point your finger at your father and accuse him of not understanding you… but did you ever try to understand him?  

Several wolves approach the tree and peer up at Jake with eyes that reflect the shining full moon. Jake tries to silence the voice and reign his focus on the threat at hand. But the voice—the voice of family—refuses to be silenced. 

Let me tell you something about your father, Jake… If he could give all his money away for just one chance to meet his father, he would. And… if you disappear because you were too pig-headed to let go... he’d drop everything just to find you. We all would.  

Let go, Jake, and the wolves will disappear.

    Jeffrey keeps to the shadows, makes his way closer to Moustache. He moves swiftly, silently... almost silently. He hacks into his sleeve and spits a mass of phlegm into the dirt. Wheezes. Could use a smoke and a shot’a something. Bah, keep moving. Skulks past the cotton candy stand and around the fortune teller’s tent. No use drawing it out any further. It’s time. Bring on the clown!<br><br>Jeffrey paces slowly from the shadows. Large, imposing, smeared in grease paint, wearing a ridiculous coat of stripes, polka dots, and patches. And the blade, beauty in simplicity. That’s all it takes. Moustache squeals like a pig and scurries. All according to plan. Corral him past the pony stables, around the freak show, and—cut him off. Give him nowhere to run but the Haunted Hostel and really have some fun with the chump. Moustache sprints towards the rundown shack, covered in spatters of red paint and cheap imitation spider webs. But then—he turns. Beelines away from the Haunted Hostel and towards... no, not that—the Fun House of Friendship. All the makeup in the world can't cover the disgust. A deep, resigned sigh. Jeffrey stands in front of a bright pink and blue building painted in smiling, cartoonish faces of giraffes, elephants, and bears. A sign on the front says ‘50 Cents Admission—You’re in for a Ton of Safe, Friendly Fun’. Damnit all.

The woman turns to her slightly and Yui realizes she's staring at an older version of herself. Grey hair, bloodshot eyes, tears streaming down her face. Older Yui stares at younger Yui with longing. Then older Yui shakes her head, turns and jumps. Younger Yui rushes to the edge and stares down at countless bodies busted and broken over jagged rocks. All of them... her. She has sudden flashes of a life she doesn't recognize, a life where she never left Hida or pursued her dream. A life where she became a teacher like her father. None of it makes sense. She covers her face with her young hands and screams and suddenly wakes up in her bed lying in a pool of sticky, cold sweat.

Rumors of endless massacres terrify him, and he hopes his mother and father will soon return. They heard a radio broadcast promising safety to those hiding and they left with others to investigate. He spent the whole day staring at the dirt road leading out of the village waiting for them to return. A few returned with wounds and horror stories. Endless stories of death, destruction and mayhem. He didn’t understand any of them. They hate us. Why? Why do they hate us? Because the radio and the television tell them to. What did I ever do to them? You were born in newly created Nigeria, that’s what you did. You were born a Northerner. His grandmother approaches. Did you see anything out there? Philip shakes his head. If you see anything… if you see danger… ring your father’s bell and hide with the others. Philip nods and stares at the bell. Will they come back? His grandmother hesitates for a long moment. I don’t... I don’t think so, Philip. They’re hiding. Tears fill his eyes as his grandmother disappears into a small thatched home. He feels a tear slip down his face, and he knows, just knows... he will never see his parents again.

    Three hours and still nothing but that foreboding melody. More than anything she wishes she had taken some time to realign herself and make sure she was spending her life's energy on something real and true to who she was. Instead she squandered her life's energy on… acts and routines and her piggy bank. That wasn't supposed to happened. Not to her. One of her inspirations was the great Woody Guthrie. Everything he wrote was true to who he was. Everything he did came from him. Came from a real and pure place. She was like that at some point in her life. But now… now she's performed more fluff than substance and the guilt alone may have crushed her muse. Her real muse. Not this perverted version of a thing that has her strumming the loneliest and darkest tune she ever conceived. She prepares to countdown but sees… a symbol on the ground before her… glowing and pulsing with the tune… pulsing like the heartbeat of some primordial, ancient thing. She closes her eyes and opens them again and the symbol is gone.

    Born in the dust-ridden badlands of the American Midwest, Caleb Quinn was son to struggling Irish immigrants. On the edge of the frontier, sickness, famine, and death were common sights, and pioneers contended for whatever scraps they could claim while tycoons feasted. Caleb's father, once an engineer, had few options to ply his trade as businesses posted a common sign: No Irish Need Apply. His antiquated tools laid untouched for years until Caleb uncovered them. Noticing his son’s interest in the trade, he gifted him his old wrench.<br><br>The devices Caleb made under his father’s guidance had quaint applications, but when his father was away, they took a grim turn. He hid plans for a mask that would gouge barbed needles into a human’s eyes and rip them from their sockets, complete with sketches of it fitted on boys who bullied him.<br><br>With age, Caleb's engineering abilities became marketable and employers put their discrimination aside. Henry Bayshore, the owner of United West Rail, hired him.<br><br>Caleb first invented a gun that shot railroad spikes into the ground. Next, he made a steam-powered tunneling drill. But as Bayshore feigned indifference, the devices began turning up at other companies, the patents stolen from Caleb and sold.<br><br>A familiar sensation coursed through Caleb's blood, feeding the sharp pain in his heart. Rage overwhelming him, he burst into Bayshore’s office and smashed his face into a bloody stew. As he was pulled away, he pushed his specialized gun to his boss’ gut and squeezed the trigger. A railroad spike plowed through skin and viscera, nailing Bayshore to his desk.<br><br>The only thing that saved Caleb from hanging was Bayshore's unlikely survival. For fifteen years, Caleb was confined to Hellshire Penitentiary, the nation’s first private prison. In a fortress of illiterate convicts, he found an unlikely friend in the educated prison warden. He designed torture devices for him and in return received extra meals. After a time, the warden offered to commute his sentence. He spoke of something greater than monetary wealth—political capital—and that his connections could have Bayshore framed and rotting behind bars for life. He had only one request: Make him rich. Fill the prison. Use ingenuity to bring outlaws in alive.<br><br>Caleb returned to his workshop, and with a few modifications emerged with something new—the speargun. The first trial occurred when a thief robbed a Chinese laundry. Seizing on the opportunity, Caleb unleashed his prototype. Metal joints screeched as the spike shot forward, gouging into the target's abdomen. But as the spear tugged it caught the thief's intestines and, with an ungodly sound, yanked them onto the dusty road. After several iterations the disembowelments dwindled, but Caleb had already earned his new nickname: The Deathslinger.<br><br>Looking to protect his asset, the prison warden pulled strings and released Irish inmates to form Caleb's posse. The Hellshire Gang was born. For six years they roamed the country collecting wanted outlaws for the prison, fulfilling their end of the bargain. After a bloody battle at Glenvale, Caleb caught notice of a newspaper headline: Henry Bayshore Purchases Hellshire Penitentiary. In the picture, a disfigured Bayshore proudly shook the warden’s hand. Caleb's heart pounded with rage, blood swelling as if it would burst from his veins. He’d been sold out, a pawn in a rich man's game.<br><br>The Hellshire Gang pledged their loyalty to Caleb and called for the warden’s head. In a thundering gallop, they smashed through the prison entrance, shrieking like bloodthirsty marauders.  A guard raised his pistol but hesitated. A spear punctured his chest. Caleb grabbed the man's head and slammed it against a prison cell until it spilled through the bars.<br><br>Reaching the warden's office, Caleb kicked the door and was met with a fortunate sight—it wasn’t only the prison warden who cowered in a corner, but Henry Bayshore. Overpowered with rage, Caleb rushed Bayshore, beating, bludgeoning, tearing at his flesh. The man's blood dripped from his face, crimson pooling at his feet. The Hellshire Gang swarmed the warden, snapping bones with each kick.<br><br>With the two men broken and begging for death, the posse dragged them to the commons where they were left to the growing crowd of prisoners.<br><br>Soaked in blood and sweat, Caleb hobbled to his old cell, hardly paying notice to Bayshore’s screams. He sat on the bed’s edge as drops of blood ran from his fingertips. A thick, unnatural fog streamed through the barred window. He pulled out his old wrench, cracked and rusted, and ran a thumb along the metal, regarding it with faded eyes. He couldn’t remember when it came into his possession. He didn’t care to remember. At his feet he saw a dusty path, and, at its end, silhouettes of all who had done him wrong: the boys who bullied him, the executives who took advantage of him, and, again... Henry Bayshore. Emerging from a fog were the tools to dispose of them—unforgiving steel hooks, brilliant and beautiful in their simplicity. Pain tore through his leg as he stood but he endured, pushing onward, walking the dusty path, leaving a trail of blood flowing behind him.

And one day Andrew’s foreman had to pay Sally a visit, forever changing her life. With no other option, Sally had to find a way but the only employment she could get was at the Crotus Prenn Asylum. She started at the bottom, doing the hard night shift. Over the years, her mind had reached its limits, decades of seeing horrid things that violate the eyes. Finally, she could not take it anymore and concepts of purification emerged inside her. As the morning staff arrived one day in September, they found over fifty patients dead in their beds, and four staff members, also dead. Only Sally had survived the night but her mind was gone, rocking back and forth non-stop. They got her into an ambulance, but that ambulance never reached the hospital. It was found crashed in a nearby wood, all the staff dead and Sally nowhere to be found.

    Four Russian soldiers lurk around the tent searching for their missing comrade. Anna stealthily tracks one soldier, inching closer and closer with every step. Poor pea-green mule.  He has no sense these will be his last few breaths. She watches him for a long moment then strategically steps on a twig. The crack makes him turn, but before he meets Anna's gaze, her axe splits his nose between the eyes, smashing his teeth and severing his tongue. She covers his bloody mouth with her hand as she rummages through his pockets for the perfect gift. Nothing. She raises her hand to let the choking, gurgling sounds lure the other three. Carefully they approach with bayonets raised and ready. She grinds her teeth in fury and bloodlust. She rolls their comrade's severed head in their midst. A moment of shock and it's all she needs as she leaps out and drops two soldiers with one lash of her axe. The other soldier rushes in with a scream and she meets him with a sweeping stroke that severs his head clean off the torso.  A geyser of blood erupts as his headless torso staggers stupidly back and forth as though searching for its lost head. The torso staggers forward then pitches backward and collapses. The sounds of another attack reach her before the blade. She lashes left and right and the body collapses in mangled pieces. The soldier stares at the pieces of his body around him in terror. She laughs and thinks about that story her mother used to tell her. Sorry yaytso. Can't be put together again.

    Haddie entered the small deli in Manhattan, New York, approached a small booth, and plopped an envelope in front of her stepbrother Jordan. He stopped chewing his early morning, scrambled eggs and asked, “What’s this supposed to be?”  

“I know who our mysterious benefactor is!” Haddie opened the envelope and pulled out a picture of a middle-aged man with salt and pepper hair in a dark suit.  

Jordan shrugged. “Who am I looking at?” 

“Surin Rivera. He was a sound engineer for a highly classified military project in the Office of Strategic Operations. He experienced a nervous breakdown and was institutionalized for years until he was released under the care of billionaire, philanthropist Kobe Dax. Others in the same program experienced similar breakdowns. One lives close by. The question is… why is Surin helping us?”  

Jordan raised his finger and pointed to a man standing behind Haddie. “Why don’t you ask him yourself?” Haddie turned to face the man in the picture standing beside her.  

Surin took a seat beside Jordan and said, “You need to leave my case alone. I assure you both… You’re not ready for what you’re prying into.”  

“And what is that?” Haddie questioned.  

Jordan took a small, nervous bite of his eggs and chewed slowly. “Let’s not provoke the man, sis. If we’re not ready... we’re not ready... I’m good with that.”  

“How do you know our uncle?” Haddie asked when he didn’t answer her question. “Why are you helping us? What are these places you’re sending us to?”  

Surin peered at Haddie for a long moment. Then he said, “Let’s just say I have a fond interest in your work and your special abilities.”  

Jordan swallowed and shrugged. “Okay... sure... that’s good enough for me.”  

“Not me.” Haddie’s face hardened as she waited for an answer. “I want to know why your helping us.”  

Surin scanned the deli nervously, then turned back to Haddie and Jordan. “Take my advice and don’t go down this rabbit hole. Not yet. You’re not ready, and you’re exposing yourself to dangerous people.”  

“What kind of people?” Haddie narrowed her gaze on him. “Police? Military? What are we talking about here?”  

Surin shook his head gravely. “We’re talking about people who don’t answer to the police or military. People who create governments and corporations to use to their end and then throw them away like garbage when they’re done.”  

“What do they want?” Haddie asked, unsatisfied with his answer.  

Surin stood. “Leave my case alone. Focus on the show and the leads I send your way. All will be revealed in due time.” 

Haddie held up the envelope with his picture. “I’m getting ahead of myself… is that it?” 

“Leave my case alone,” Surin repeated and walked away.  

Haddie and Jordan watched Surin exit the deli in silence. Then Jordan turned to see Haddie’s determined expression, and he knew they weren’t leaving anything alone.

    As soon as Anna was able to walk, her mother started teaching her how to survive a harsh, solitary life in the northern woods. Living in such an extremely remote and dangerous area required skill and resilience. When sunlight became too dim for productive activities, they would take refuge in their house, a sturdy old cabin constructed to resist the toughest winters. Close to the hearth’s warmth, Anna would rest in her mother’s arms, surrounded by the few wooden toys and masks she had crafted for her. Drifting off to sleep with stories and lullabies, she dreamt happy dreams, ignorant of the events that would soon change everything.<br><br>Anna and her mother were stalking a great elk through the woods. They knew it was dangerous prey, but it had been a particularly difficult winter and they were almost out of food. The specter of starvation frightened them more than any forest creature. Without warning, the elk reared, bellowed and charged at Anna. She was paralyzed with fear as the whole world seemed to shake under the immense beast's pounding hooves. The elk was close enough for Anna to see the murderous fury in its eyes when her mother threw herself in its path, axe in hand. A bloodcurdling scream escaped from her lips as the elk impaled her upon its antlers and hoisted her into the air. With all her strength, she brought her axe down on its head again and again while it tried to shake her loose. With a sickening crack, the antlers snapped and Anna's mother was free. The beast collapsed.<br><br>Anna was too small to move her mother's broken body, so she sat with her in the clearing where she had fallen. To distract her from the dying elk's cries, Anna's mother held her and hummed her favorite lullaby. They stayed like that, the huntress and the elk getting quieter and colder, until Anna was alone in the silent forest. Eventually she stood up and started the long walk back home.<br><br>Still a child, she knew just enough about life in the frozen forest to survive. She followed her instincts and became one with the wild. She got older and stronger and practiced her hunt. As she grew into a dangerous predator, her humanity became a half-remembered dream.<br><br>She widened her territory and lived off her hunts. She worked her way up through squirrels and hares and mink and foxes. Eventually she grew tired of them and hunted more dangerous animals like wolves and bears. When unsuspecting travelers came through her woods, she discovered her new favorite prey: humans. Unlucky souls who strayed into her territory were slaughtered like any other animal. She liked to collect their tools and colorful garments and especially toys when there were little ones. But she could never bring herself to kill the little girls.<br><br>Girls she would take back to her house, deep in the woods. They were precious, and looking at them woke up something deep in her heart. She craved the closeness of a loved one, a child of her own. Among the pillaged wooden toys, dolls and story books she couldn’t read, the girls would be tied by the neck with a rough and chafing rope fastened firmly to the wall. She couldn’t let them wander off, or they would surely die outside.<br><br>Every time, the girls would waste away and die of cold or starvation or sickness. Every time, it plunged Anna deeper into pain and sorrow and madness. She was compelled to try again, and started raiding the nearest villages to slaughter families and kidnap their daughters. She wore one of the animal masks her mother crafted for her so many years earlier to try to calm the frightened children. Villagers spread the legend of a half-beast lurking in Red Forest: The Huntress, who killed men and ate little girls.<br><br>War eventually came to the forest. German soldiers began to pass through, on the march to attack the collapsing Russian Empire. During these dark times, there were no more travelers. The villagers had abandoned their homes, and no more little ones to be found; only soldiers. Many of them were found with violent axe wounds. Whole groups disappeared mysteriously. Once the war was over, the rumours of The Huntress disappeared with it, engulfed by the Red Forest.

At night, she would stay up, tormented by the thought of disappointing her parents… and her fans. She spiraled out of control and fell into a pattern of self-destruction. She started wandering the streets and visiting bars, waking up in places she didn’t remember. One day she woke up somewhere completely different…

    What does it mean to be authentic? How does one follow one’s destiny despite the pressures of family and tradition? Often following one‘s path is a strenuous, narrow struggle full of unexpected joys and difficulties. Ultimately it’s about finding the balance between tradition and self-actualization. But as one struggles for identity, decisions are made and consequences, good or bad, must be faced.

Heir to a famous Japanese swordsmanship school, Kazan Yamaoka sought to surpass his reputation as a warrior by turning his back on honor and family and embarking on a dark pilgrimage of bloodlust. As he waged his personal war against self-proclaimed samurai, he was bestowed with the derogatory and despised nickname of Oni-Yamaoka, a reference to the hideous creature of legend. One day, he met his fate as his former victims took revenge on him. It drew The Entity’s attention and he was deemed worthy of becoming part of its world, joining the other killers there, but ironically under the very form he had been compared to in his former life.

Quick, daring and superstitious, Yui Kimura was one of the youngest motorcyclists to break records in unsanctioned street races as well as the very prestigious Moto Grand Prix of Japan. Breaking with tradition and against her parents’ wishes, she left her home to pursue her dreams of racing and led a gang helping women in troubled situations. Until she found herself roped into another endless race where crossing the finish line was a matter of life and death.

He only remembers waking up on the couch in Donnie's apartment. He’s lost his edge. His anger. His rage. His hate. Was that all he was? Donnie's asking if he's okay and he's not sure. Am I okay? Will I be better? I don't know. Was it just a fluke? A lucky shot? Happens to the best. I feel wrecked. I am wrecked. Donnie bet the last of his cash on him.

    Dwight listens in disbelief to stories of Lazar. Real life horror stories. Stories that defy reason for this day and age. It's a yearly ritual for those who have had the misfortune to work with Lazar. They've all gathered to watch the leaked Peak 22 recruitment video. Dozens of people, each wearing a white Peak 22 t-shirt with a ridiculous Lazar quote they scribbled on with marker. One of them worked with Lazar at a production company where he tried to produce a terrible web series he wrote. It's about an alien computer that takes over the world and controls its inhabitants with a matrix that simulates reality.  No one told him he just pitched the premise of a major blockbuster film. She imitates Lazar selling his web series. It's different. It's unique. It's not horror, it's not sci-fi… it's terror… sheer terror… it's… it's a new genre… it's Simulated Terror. Lazar believed he had created the next big genre like cosmic horror. The writer shows a book written by Lazar. Simulated Terror. Guidelines for writers in his new genre. They all burst out laughing. Dwight laughs so hard it hurts. Who says Story-Hook when they mean story? Or Simulated Terror when they mean sci-fi? The stories of the Naked Emperor continue throughout the night and Dwight is convinced there is no justice. Peak 22's ex-Story-Hook supervisor talks about how Lazar called him a ‘weak male' for not wanting to ‘cyber bully' a blogger for using the term ‘Story-Hook.' He tells them about a harmless drug that makes people laugh absurdly at every little sound. He says if he was still working at Peak 22 he'd give Lazar a little taste of his own medicine. Others agree. That would be hilarious. Dwight likes the idea. Likes it a lot.  It might be that justice works in mysterious ways. He approaches Max. Tell me more about this harmless drug.

    Slash tires? Sounds a bit extreme. Meg regrets showing Coach Jenny how fast she could run during Phys Ed class. She saw something she liked, asked Meg to run, and now she wants her to race at the State Championships. From a virtual nobody to glorified jock almost overnight. New friends, bitter rivals and rumors abound. Why Meg? Why does she get a free ticket?  She never practiced, sucked up, or took diet pills to keep her weight in check. Why her? What makes her so special? The idea of a free ticket makes Meg laugh. No free ticket for her. She’s always loved to run, just not in an organized way, and she’s quite certain she put more hours into her passion than anyone else on the team.  

The team dresses Meg up in bandit costume with black and white stripes like a criminal in a silent film. It’s so stupid she wants to scream. Two team members argue over the costume and finally decide on dropping the cliché bandit look for a more contemporary supervillain costume.  They make a mask and tell her to slash tires near the police station. Then they exchange anxious looks with one another. Sounds less like initiation and more like a way to get her off the team and into a prison cell. Dana gives her a strange look, a dirty look. Seems like she has an upset stomach, gas even. She hates Meg for beating her time and probably wants to see her locked up. The rest of the team thinks up supervillain names for Meg. Street Rusher. Super Blaster. Dare Diva. Whatever. They’re all stupid. Just choose a name already.

    A symbol of life, though from another perspective, it's the vessel that ferries one to death.
    Growing up in a Lebanese household in Brooklyn, Zarina struggled with two unique cultural identities. She felt this cultural difference painted a target on her back. To avoid ridicule and bullies, she observed what popular kids liked and learned to project the image they preferred. At school, she would go by the name "Karina," dye her hair lighter, and trash her “foreign” lunches.<br><br>At home, the news channel was always on. Urgent reports of injustice captivated Zarina, inspiring her to produce her own stories. When she was a teenager, she embraced her real name and roots and borrowed her father’s digital camera to interview members of her community in Bay Ridge. By posting her content online, she slowly built a loyal following. Each week, she picked a new issue and challenged people to speak their mind on camera.<br><br>When she heard a rumor that a fast-food restaurant owner was exploiting workers, she decided to go undercover and produce a hard-hitting film. She modified her look, faked an accent, and secured a waitress position at the restaurant. After three weeks of unpaid work, she was fired for demanding her paycheck. To retaliate, she posted clips of the restaurant owner’s abusive behavior and within hours the news had picked up her story, but somehow spun it to create sympathy for the restaurant owner.<br><br>Embittered by the experience, Zarina committed to become an independent producer and filmmaker. Her first feature film was for a competition at school inspired by an English class poem about Sacco and Vanzetti, two Italian migrants controversially executed for murder. Her film won first prize and launched her as an uncompromising documentary filmmaker.<br><br>Months later, her world turned upside down. A public video surveillance camera filmed her father carrying two coffees at a street corner a few blocks from home. A tall, hooded man stood behind him. The man shouted something at her father who took a step back, startled. Suddenly and unexpectedly, the man pushed him in the street as a car sped by.<br><br>His death sent a shockwave of anger and pain that left Zarina in pieces.<br><br>The perpetrator—Clark Stevenson—was soon arrested and incarcerated for manslaughter.<br><br>Zarina became obsessed with Clark--his gang “IR-28”, his short prison sentence, his apparent lack of remorse. A year went by and she had uncovered enough about Clark to shed more light on his crime. With the last of her inheritance she bought a new camera and a plane ticket to Nebraska and bribed the warden at Hellshire Penitentiary to let her interview Clark.<br><br>She filmed their first meeting and asked him about her father and his gang and his violent tendencies. Clark refused to talk; but, in the weeks that followed, she used her research to push his buttons and finally got a confession of a pre-meditated crime.<br><br>Zarina’s film became a tribute to her father and the trail of blood left by gang violence. When the news finally picked up the story, it was because the film had gained international acclaim.<br><br>Some inmates contacted her when they heard about her documentary. Most of them shared eccentric anecdotes in hopes of being filmed, but one story stood out from the rest: an entire wing in Hellshire Penitentiary was sealed off because of the “Mad Mick Massacre.” The official story was an Irish outlaw had heartlessly slaughtered the warden and his guards.<br><br>From working on her Sacco and Vanzetti film, Zarina knew that the ‘official’ story wasn’t always the ‘true’ story. She investigated Hellshire’s records and found an Irish-American inmate sentenced to twenty years for assault in 1860. According to the penitentiary’s blueprint, the sealed off wing was part of Hellshire’s original infrastructure. If she reached that sealed off section, she could shed some light on the Mad Mick story. All she needed was a way in.<br><br>Next morning, she was joining the Hellshire Penitentiary walking tour. She blended in the crowd of jet-lagged tourists and veered off when they headed toward the kitchen. She’d memorized the blueprint and knew exactly where to go and how to avoid surveyance cameras. An unexpected security detail nearly cut her investigation short, but she was able to hide under an old, dusty prison bed. When the guards disappeared, she continued her search and finally found Mick’s cell.<br><br>Entering the dark, dilapidated cell, Zarina ran her hand across the old brick wall. Her fingers felt a marking and traced the letters: DEATH TO BAYSHORE. A loose brick fell, revealing a gap.<br><br>She inserted her hand. Fingers landed on a piece of cold, cracked metal. She fished it out… an old, rusty wrench. A damp chill ran down her spine and she looked down; a man lay at her feet, bleeding, his limbs contorted and his eyes, dark and terrified—her father’s eyes. A pool of crimson blood on black pavement. Paralyzed, black fog filled the cell and she shut her eyes to push these nightmarish visions out of her mind.

    What are you and the moms doing? Nea approaches Casey and several middle-aged women handing out water bottles and cases to local residents. Casey turns to Nea. What are we doing? Anything we can to help. Nea laughs and nudges Casey.  Let's go to the park. Casey nudges her back. Not today Nea, this is important... another day... Nea watches Casey and the other women handing out water to the poor. How many kids at home? Three? Okay, here's a dozen bottles. Four? Okay, take an extra container. When is our water going to be safe? The hell if I know. Is it dangerous to shower? To do the laundry? How bad is the water? Pretty bad. The water is killing our children. We need a center to treat the poisoned. Nea listens to all the talk with horror and disbelief. She's never really had to think about something as basic and essential as water and now... she's thinking about water... polluted water... and the poor in her city. They're saying it's the worst case of Minamata disease in the country. She doesn't know what that is... Minamata... but it sounds bad, real bad. What's Minamata? Casey looks upset or disturbed as she hands out another container of fresh water to a resident. It's what happens when people are poisoned with mercury. Nea sighs, feels for the residents, but knows shit happens and there's just not much you can do about it. We can't save the world, Casey? What's a few containers of bottled water gonna do? Casey freezes and gives Nea a look she doesn't quite understand. It's a moment before she responds. Yeah, well, maybe we can't save the world, Nea, but we can sure as hell make it a little bit better, and that's good enough for me.

    Another way for Killers to track Survivors is by following the bloodstains that they leave behind while injured or dying. Bloodstains are harder to see than scratch marks, but are more accurate and a Survivor cannot stop bleeding until they heal. Blood in front of a locker, for example, is a dead giveaway. Like the scratch marks, bloodstains will disappear after a few seconds.

    Chamber of Blood. Harbinger of Hell. Beneath the Ruins 3.<br><br>"This way!" Haddie yelled, leading Jordan through the shadow and light spilling through the forest canopy. She could hear the creature shrieking as it hunted them with unnatural speed and resolve. Spotting an outcrop of jagged rocks, she quickly yanked her brother into hiding.  

"Aren't vampires supposed to explode in sunlight?" Jordan asked.  "I mean, isn't that what's supposed to happen!? Doesn't it know it's supposed to be dead?"  

Haddie instantly placed a finger by his quivering lips as she heard footfalls approaching. She repressed an urge to look at the creature. Instead, she listened. She could hear the clattering and hissing coming from its hungry jaws. She could hear the crunch of stones and the distinct snap of twigs as the creature searched for them. Then the footfalls seemed to change direction, growing fainter and fainter until all she heard was the chirping of insects.  

Haddie heaved a shuddering breath.  

Jordan gulped and swallowed a lump in his throat, saying, "We should have respected the warning."   

"If that's what it was… a warning…"   

"What else could it be?" 

"I don't know… What I do know is… we've released something foul into the world."   

"And by foul you mean the vampire and not gas," Jordan said with a smirk. "Just clarifying."  

"Not funny." 

"A little funny." 

"No. Not even a little."  

Haddie risked moving beyond the rocks. She glanced apprehensively, half expecting the creature to hurl itself at them. When nothing happened, she stood and, slowly and quietly, led Jordan back toward their guide.   

As she pushed her way through the woods, she couldn't help but notice the similarities between all the symbols she had seen at the last few investigation sites. They were unlike anything she had ever seen before and she had discovered them in completely different parts of the world. India. Africa. Portugal. England. Paris. And now…  Turkey.   

Haddie couldn't help but feel something was amiss. She broke the silence, saying, "We're being pulled into something far more complex than we've been led to believe. Almost like… we're being used…" 

"Used? For what? Who cares about a bunch of bozos from Montreal who release foul things into the world?" 

Haddie shook her head, gave him a grave look and answered, "I don't know. But I think it's about time we meet our mysterious—" 

A twig snapped, startling the siblings.  

Before Haddie could finish her thought, the creature stood framed between two trees, dappled in sunlight.   

Jordan screamed in terror as the creature lunged at him, grabbing his arm and sinking its boney claws into his skin. With a mighty roar, the creature hurled him against a tree with a thud. Groaning, he sagged to the ground as inky blackness seeped down over his vision. 

Haddie thought quickly, spotting a fallen branch on the ground.  

The creature inched closer to Jordan, staring at him as though he were a steak.  It kneeled before him and prepared to sink its fangs into Jordan's neck to satiate its red thirst. Just as it opened its gaping mouth, a resounding yell interrupted it. 

The creature hissed and turned just in time to receive a branch across the face. It fell to the side, then scrambled to its feet, locking eyes with Haddie. 

Haddie backed away slowly, glad she had saved her brother from certain doom, but unsure what would happen next. Then, inspired by the vampire films she had seen with her uncle Stefan, she turned the sharp side of the branch to face the creature just as it pounced on her like a lion.  

The make-shift stake hit its mark, skewering the creature straight through its monstrous heart.  

The creature shrieked something awful and collapsed to its knees, holding the stake.  
Wiping her brow, Haddie stepped away from the creature and approached her brother. But a sudden squelching sound froze her to the core. Slowly, she turned to watch the creature pull out the stake with the pulpy, dead heart still attached.  

The creature tossed the heart to the side with a mangled smile. An instant later, it pounced over Haddie, taking her to the ground. Haddie pushed and jerked under its powerful grip as it salivated and peered hungrily at the thick arterial vein pumping in her neck.  

Saliva dripped down Haddie's neck slow, warm and slimy like a slug. She screamed, and then had no breath to scream and began to see not stars but…geometry… symbols… symbols she had previously discovered in The Overlap as she often called it. She didn't know what else to call what she understood to be a Venn intersection of worlds where she could see and access knowledge and memories no one else could.  

Haddie closed her eyes and saw the twisted triangle symbol she had just uncovered in an ancient temple. Then she saw the strange circle slashed in half with a line that she had discovered all over the walls and floor of an abandoned asylum as though someone or something was conducting dark experiments in The Overlap on the patients. It was all very bizarre and new to her. 

Now, as the creature prepared to feast on her blood, Haddie wasn't seeing memories pass before her eyes but all these strange and arcane symbols that felt older than life itself—as though someone or something were trying to send her a message from The Overlap.
    As the Killer, you must hunt down and sacrifice all the Survivors. This tutorial will teach you the basics needed to appease The Entity.

    Claudette is seven years old and feels alone. Very alone. Yes, her parents love her. Yes, they want the world for her. But the world doesn't want her. Or, at least, that's what Claudette believes. She just wants to fit in. Fit in at school. Fit in with her cousins. Fit in with her teammates on the soccer pitch. But fitting in isn't as simple as being like others. She's different and she knows it.<br><br>She feels slow. Unresponsive. Not quick enough to understand her teacher or keep up with her class.  The librarian calls her ‘addle minded.' When she talks, she stutters. Sometimes she loses her breath and has trouble recognizing when she's talking too loudly. But most of all her teacher embarrasses her. Says she's in the clouds. Always in the clouds. Get out of the clouds, Claudette! But she can't help it. She's exploring massive gardens and colorful bugs on strange new worlds.

    The first step to complete in order to escape is to repair the 5 generators. There are a few things to keep in mind while doing so:<br><br><b>Generator Locations:</b> Generator locations are randomly selected before the trial, so they cannot simply be memorized. To find the generators, Survivors can try looking out for the flashing lights above them or listen out for the sounds of partially repaired generators.<br><br><b>Killer Patrols:</b> Killers can see the auras of unrepaired and partially repaired generators. When not engaged in a chase, Killers will often patrol the generators searching for Survivors. <br><br><b>Skill Checks:</b> Survivors should be listening out for the Skill Check audio cue while repairing generators. Failing a Skill Check will cause the generator to explode, which sets back the repair progress and alerts the Killer.<br><br><b>Careful Repairs:</b> Repairing a generator takes time and makes noise that can attract the Killer; Survivors need to be on their guard. It's a good idea to plan one or more escape routes in case the Killer approaches.<br><br><b>The Escape:</b> Once the <b>5</b> generators have been repaired, a level-wide siren will alert all players that the exit gates can be opened. Survivors will only be shown the exit locations for a limited time, so they will need to remember where they are. Many Survivors have been caught at the end of a trial searching the perimeter for the exit!<br><br>If the <b>Endgame Collapse</b> is triggered before all generators are repaired then they will become blocked off by The Entity.

    Meg confides in her mother at the kitchen table. She’s convinced Dana arranged for someone to wound her to discourage her from running. Anger overwhelms her and she says things she wouldn’t normally say. I want her dead. I want to crush her like a bug. I want her to burn in fucking hell. I would have won that race! Her mother listens to her without judgment and waits for her to calm down. You’re very upset and I understand, but don’t... don’t stoop to her level, don’t let her turn you into what you’re not. You want revenge? Best revenge is success. Let her know you’re the best even at your worst and that will be her worst frecking hell. Meg narrows her eyes on her mother. Her mother squeezes her hand. If you think you’re beaten, you are. If you think you can’t, you can’t. Life’s battles aren’t won with speed and strength, but mind and will. Tears fill Meg’s eyes. Not because of her mother’s advice… but because she knows her mother’s days are numbered… and this probably one of their last be-positive, pep talks.  

Her mother hands over a box she pulls from under the table. Meg lifts the lid to reveal a black dress unlike anything she’s ever seen or worn. Before she can say anything her mother laughs. Not only will you win, but you’ll be the jewel of the afterparty. Meg feels a lump growing in her throat. Don’t lose all your strength focusing on the negative. Her mother used to be a competitive tennis player. All Meg heard growing up was stories about Billie Jean King. Meg waits for the ‘listen-to-win’ pep talk she’s heard so many times she’s lost count. Her mother relates how she would listen to a radio broadcast of King’s game to steer her mind away from fear and negativity. Fill your brain with success so there’s no room for fear. She’s prepared a special mix for Meg on her pod. Meg takes the pod and stares at it a moment, a long moment. Then she leaps across the table and embraces her mother and never wants to let go.

    King hasn't felt real in a long time. He sits in Donnie's apartment drinking old ale, realizing how much he misses genuine heart-to-hearts. Donnie was his friend before he realized he came from money. The rich aren't really rich. He's not sure why he thinks this or what it means. It's just a random thought. The ale talking as it were. Donnie says he can stay until he figures things out. He's not sure when that will be. It doesn't matter. A sudden rap at the door startles him. Donnie stands. Opens the door to reveal a few men in black leather jackets. Muscle. King doesn't hear much. What he does hear he doesn't like. Donnie owes money and can expect a bundle of lead in the face if he doesn't pay. He laughs when he returns to the kitchen table. It’s your fault, King. I don’t know who to bet on anymore.

    Some humans are simply bad seeds. Seeds infused with a distilled and pure form of evil. Michael Myers is one of those seeds. He had no issues with causing the pain of others. Instead, it was exactly what he sought. But even life can be tough on those with minds filled with terror. The difference is just how one goes about to solve those problems.<br><br>For Michael, he had to kill to find some inner peace. As he took his sister’s life, the police found a silent boy dressed as a clown at the scene. When one stumbles upon a growing fire, one does not pour gasoline on it. But this was an action taken by officials that had no idea how it would shape this demon in the boy’s body. Sending Michael to a mental institution was a feeble attempt to save the child. Unsuccessful therapy and nightly screams just made him even more introvert and deranged. People hoped that Michael Myers would end up a parenthesis, soon to be forgotten and buried, a failure that soon were to rot away. But then…he escaped.<br>

King tells Donnie he needs to get home before the beer he’s drinking turns to piss. Before he gets in trouble. Too late. King spots two men. They approach Donnie. Grab him.

    Max hands Dwight a mix of his laughing drug. It will make him giggle and laugh so much he'll piss his pants. Pour it in his coffee right before his meeting and you'll have a ‘Story-Hook' unlike any other for next year's roast. Dwight smiles. He feels his heart pounding his chest. Rose will have justice. Everyone will. Dwight will teach this abuser that sometimes the little guy bites back. Inspired, he asks one of his colleagues to distract Lazar while he spikes his coffee. Another colleague listens to the plan and shakes her head skeptically. She isn't sure. She doesn't like this prank and cautions Dwight to think things through. I've got two kids, she says, and the last thing I want is for the investors to close down shop because he hallucinates or hurts someone. Dwight laughs. Don't worry. The most that will happen is he'll act like a donkey. Dwight lifts his chin proudly and reassures her no one will get hurt. He places his hand on her shoulder and feels like the leader he always knew he's been. Nothing bad will happen or my name isn't Dwight.

    “Come on, bro! Let’s get ahead of ourselves!” Haddie led Jordan to the entrance of a dilapidated house in the suburbs. “Colonel Jim Dunn worked with Surin Rivera in the OSO.” Before Haddie could say another word the door creaked open, revealing a plump, middle-age woman with short blond hair.  

“Can I help you?” 

Haddie smiled. “Yes. I was actually hoping to speak to Col Lt Dunn for our podcast.”  

The woman took a step back. “Is this some kind of a prank?”  

Haddie shook her head. “No, ma’am.” 

“Jim disappeared seven years ago. No one has any answers for me, and all I’m left with are rumors.” 

Jordan inched closer to the woman. “Maybe our podcast could help? Maybe someone out there can help you if you share his story.”  

“Share his story?” The woman hesitated for a moment. Then she nodded and said, “Yeah... all right... I just want my Jim back.”  

Haddie and Jordan entered the home and followed her to the kitchen where they sat around a small, round table.  

“I can only tell you what Jim told me,” the woman said, taking a deep breath and releasing it slowly to calm her nerves. “He worked for the Office of Strategic Operations which was... I guess you could say... the stuff of conspiracy theories.”  

She paused, then continued. “Did you know Jim said the word ‘conspiracy theory’ used to never exist until the military created the term? Once you could actually question the government’s narrative but now… you’re not questioning anything because you don’t want to be called a ‘conspiracy theorist.’” 

The woman laughed, then added, “Brilliant, really, and that’s pretty much why no one questions the government anymore... even if you’ve got a dozen whistleblowers with leaked documents all saying the same thing... you don’t really doubt or question anything cause you don’t want to be stigmatized.” 

The woman shook her head in disbelief and continued with a little laugh. “Jim used to say the origin of ‘conspiracy theory’ is a conspiracy theory… anyway… he told me… there were places in the world that weren’t like other places… places which defied the laws of physics… which defied human comprehension… places connected to worlds away… to other dimensions… the government called it The Overlap. Crazy stuff, right? ” 

Jordan nodded.  

Haddie didn’t respond. She had heard the term before when they were investigating a mysterious cult that believed in a kind of ancient deity that would one day help humanity evolve to another plane of existence. It’s a strange coincidence that this cult and the government would have the same name for the phenomenon.  

“Like a wormhole?” Jordan questioned.  

The woman shook her head. “That’s not how Jim described it. He didn’t talk much about The Overlap but he said what they had seen made him think another world was... how did he put it... consuming ours… like these Overlaps were growing bigger and bigger as we went down a kind of celestial digestive track… and… he said… he said they were pulling stuff out… things from other worlds....”  

The woman fell silent and thoughtful for a long moment. “I could see changes in him. He was getting angrier and mean and he was never mean. He stopped sharing things with me. And I started hearing rumors.” 

“What kind of rumors?” Haddie asked, leaning forward.  

The woman went silent and thoughtful. Then she said, “Rumors that the government was doing things to them so they could stay in The Overlap for longer periods of time. I even heard that they pulled someone out from another world. Imagine that... a person from another world or dimension.” 

Tears filled her eyes. “They say he left me… but I know my Jim… something happened to him and the authorities dismiss me as conspiracy theorist for saying otherwise. But I’ll tell you this—” 

A sudden report and the woman’s mouth filled with thick, warm blood as she tried to speak. Shattered teeth and saliva gushed out instead of words. Then her eye went wide and she slumped forward.  

Jordan cursed and instantly tackled Haddie to the ground as bullets began to rip through the house from every direction.  

Haddie stared up at her brother as bullets flew over their heads like angry wasps. “I think… we got ahead of ourselves.” 

“You think!”

    This is not the Badham Preschool where children laughed and learned, made lifelong friendships and had their paintings hung on the walls. This is a dark echo created from the nightmares of those who suffered there. The walls creak under the burden of history. Events that should be long forgotten are recorded forever in the plaster and stone, pervading the building with misery. Only one part of the building is accurately reflected in this darkness. The squalid room where Freddy Krueger lived and worked. The hidden basement area where he committed the heinous acts that appalled a town and condemned him to death. This is a place of the subconscious, of the nightmare brought into hideous reality.

    Silence. Horrible, gut-wrenching silence. Philip shifts uncomfortably in their make-shift bunker and listens for something… anything. Abi nudges him. Let’s see your math skills, Philip. Math? She’s trying to distract him from the hell outside. Six plus twenty-four minus eight. He works it out. Twenty-two. She smiles and nods. She levels another challenge and another. He answers with growing tears in his eyes. She touches his face. Don’t think about what is happening outside… listen to my words and play the game. He nods and tries his best to work out her challenges... but he can’t help but think about his mother... his father... They said math would strengthen his brain. Make him good in school. Give him all kinds of opportunities his father never had. His father… he’ll never do math with him again… never play chess with him again… or hear his stories… and why? Because of men who take money to do the devil’s work.  

Abi nudges him. Philip asks her to repeat the challenge just as the cry of a toddler rips through the silence. He instantly looks to his grandmother. Her eyes go wide as she stands and approaches the ladder. Philip runs to her and grabs her hand. Don’t go... please... please... She hesitates, staring at the hatch above. I cannot leave the boy out there alone. Philip nods and wants to hold her soft, wrinkled hand forever. But he lets go and watches her as she bravely ascends the ladder and disappears into the scorching day.

    Sally, her face emotionally void, sits next to the Broken Woman's bed. She finds herself more and more in this position, listening to the woman ramble. The Broken Woman fidgets with her restraints, fixated on an unscarred piece of skin at the base of her hand. Purification comes in many forms. We must all make sacrifices. She curls a finger inwards and scratches at the clean piece of skin until it's torn off. For the most grotesque offenders—the genetic abominations—we must take extreme measures. Otherwise, you get... well, the results surround you.<br><br>Sally sits motionless, her tired eyes the only indication that she's conscious. The Broken Woman speaks as if chatting with a friend over tea. Do you know what I could do? I could tell you the ingredients for my special injection... the one I used on my patients. A quick little prick and they'll writhe as if a purifying fire burns within. A fitting way to deal with inhuman filth, wouldn't you say? Are you hearing me, sweet nurse? You don't have to be their servant anymore.

    A cool pair of shorts that give off a carefree vibe thanks to the handkerchief hanging from the pocket.
    Kate strums her guitar freely but nothing's coming to her. Just a dark, disturbing melody that's been returning to her every time she hits zero. A melody so unlike anything she's ever played that she doesn't know where the inspiration comes from. She's never played a tune so dark and yet… so catchy. The harder she tries to push the ominous melody out of her mind the stronger it gets. The more it demands to be written down. She wants the melody to stop and yet it's all she hears around her. Above her. Below her. Beside her. Within her. One endless foreboding melody. A melody that just isn't her. Or.. maybe it is her… Maybe the show-pony routine has changed her, corrupted her… perhaps even crushed her. And if not her… the best part of her… her muse. She stops strumming, closes her eyes, pushes everything out of her mind and begins a slow and patient countdown back to zero.

Or rather, she's learning how she learns and that is the key. But her teacher is doing something else.  Her teacher is talking to her. She's talking to her about her ‘issue' and how her ‘issue' is really a blessing in disguise if she can just learn how to succeed in a system that favors one type of ‘smart' at the expense of all the others.  A system that frowns on taking chances or making mistakes when making mistakes and taking chances is what is needed for learning. For true learning. Her teacher tells her that she has passion and passion is everything.

    Frank won the bet and he's collecting. Joey didn't last a month at the new job. The owner accused him of stealing a chocolate bar and now he paces the cabin hysterical. Of all the things… a chocolate bar! A chocolate bar he claims he never stole.  The injustice of it all. Julie suggests payback. Let's break into the store! Get some more supplies! Set the whole place on fire to let Ormond feel the wrath of The Legion. Joey freezes when he hears the name. Frank raises a curious eyebrow and then nods approvingly. I like it. I like it a lot. She throws them generic masks. Plain. Bland. Unimpressive. The only thing we need now is a proper mask.
    Jeff Johansen was born and raised in Ormond, Alberta. He grew up as a quiet, only child with an aversion for large crowds. During high school, his anxious nature was mislabelled as shyness, which he covered up with a tough, stoic persona that intimidated bullies and teachers alike. At home, he discovered an interest for heavy metal and started a vinyl collection. The evocative symbolism on the covers inspired him to make some art of his own, which helped him cope with his parents’ constant fighting.<br><br>To escape his parents’ increasingly recurrent blow-ups, Jeff started working at a video store. Few customers passed by, so he had a lot of free time to draw. A late-night regular noticed his sketches and asked him to do some artwork for his gang at the abandoned lodge up Mount Ormond. Jeff accepted the challenge and painted a large mural depicting “The Legion” in runny, bloody letters. He was given a fifty-dollar bill and a 12-pack for his hard work. It was his first paid commission, a milestone to be proud of.<br><br>After his parents’ divorce, Jeff was forced to move with his mother to Winkler, Manitoba, which was miles away from his hometown—and his dad. In Winkler, Jeff was more isolated than ever, except for art and music. His solace came shortly after graduating high school when he started working at a local bar with live music performances. He found a roadie gig shortly after, leaving Winkler behind.<br><br>A few years later, Jeff got injured after getting involved in a fight during a concert. He was told he could lose part of his eyesight, so his doctor asked him to stay in town in order to monitor him. It was a difficult time during which Jeff re-assessed his life choices.<br><br>He went back to school—art school. His eyesight slowly returned, but he had to be careful. He took a few courses, experimenting with a wide range of mediums, ultimately choosing oil painting and digital art, the latter of which offered paid internships. He took up a desk job and found his calling in designing labels for microbreweries. He led a quiet, simple life: he brewed beer, took-in a rescue dog, designed tattoos, and freelanced album covers for bands he liked. All until one morning, when he got a phone call from Ormond saying that his father had passed, leaving a few things to sort out.<br><br>Jeff drove all the way back to Ormond. He felt a pang of nostalgia when he reached his late father’s house. Inside, there was an old guitar case sitting in against the wall. It held a black, vintage model with a sticky note that said, “for my boy.”<br><br>He stayed in town longer than he planned to, reminiscing about his childhood. Driving by his former high school, he remembered the mural he painted up Mount Ormond. He bought a 12-pack and headed to the lodge.<br><br>After weeks of not hearing back from Jeff, his colleagues assumed that grief had gotten the better of him. His neighbor got tired of sitting his dog, which became more and more agitated as days went by. The dog became a stray again, erring while seeking the familiar trail of Jeff’s malty scent.

    Dare Damsel Meg bolts through the streets stirring up laughter and attention. She feels stupid and scared at the same time lurking about in her supervillain costume. Meg pushes down her fear, composes herself, focuses her thoughts. If they want a slashed tire, they’ll get one and more. I’ll go straight into the belly of the whale and pull out a rib. She laughs at the image. Wonders where it came from and realizes it’s from one of the stories she recently read to her mother to help her fall asleep despite her deteriorating condition. Doctors don’t know what she has, and they can’t afford the doctors anymore. Don’t let your thoughts betray you. Meg pushes her grief out of her mind as pedestrians laugh and point at her costume. I’m going to target the police and set the record of this stupid hazing ritual.

Determined, Meg approaches the Colorado police station with her heart beating at a record-breaking speed. She kneels behind a cruiser, hesitates, her hand trembles involuntarily. She’s not used to breaking the law. She takes a deep, calming breath. First time for anything. Then, with a pocketknife, she slashes a tire, yanks a piece of rubber off and backs away. Before the officers realize what’s what Meg’s a bolt of lightning. Her heart’s pounding in her throat. Her legs are a blur. The police give chase but eat her dust. She returns to the team with a piece of slashed rubber and a new team record. A police cruiser. An actual police cruiser. Beat that! The team laughs and jeers except for Dana who stares at her with her usual gas face. No one on the team has ever done anything so bold. Welcome to the team… Dare Damsel Meg.

    Chamber of Blood. Harbinger of Hell. Evil Eyes. 4.<br><br>Jordan and Haddie rushed through the cave with the screams and cries of dying brutes echoing through the bowels of the mountain. “What was that thing?” 

“I didn't get a good look and I don't really want to!” Haddie yelled and she could see the sunlight ahead but sensed they wouldn't make it. “Keep going!” She yelled and turned to face the darkness with only a flashlight.  

The hissing and crumbling faded to silence. She had no idea what she was going to do next. She narrowed her gaze, waiting. Teeth suddenly chattered and a hundred red eyes bore down on her.  

Haddie inched back and fell to the ground beside a skeleton holding a kukri in one hand and a revolver in the other. She instantly wrenched the weapons out of its boney hands and clambered to trembling feet.  

The creature approached slowly, hissing and chattering, its terrible eyes fixated on her. She stared at long arms and fingers with claws like knives. She lifted her arm and aimed the revolver at its head. Then she pulled the trigger and— 

Nothing happened.  

A hundred eyes stared down at the revolver, then back at her.  

“Shit.” 

The creature hissed, then attacked with a roar. Haddie evaded. Terrible claws swished overhead and hit the wall. Bits of rock and stone rained over her.  

Covered in debris, she sprang up and ran with the creature in pursuit. She turned in the gathering dust and instinctively felt the attack before it came as she often did. With one quick thrust of her arm, the blade of the kukri severed the hand. The creature shrieked something terrible.   

Haddie seized the opportunity to severe the head but the creature lunged away and the blade hit the stone wall. The kukri vibrated out of her hand and she dove to the ground as the creature charged her.  

Tumbling away, Haddie instinctively grabbed a slab of stone. The creature attacked and missed, hitting the wall. Without hesitation Haddie smashed the slab over its bewildered head with a terrible crunching sound she wouldn't soon forget.  

The creature collapsed and Haddie, adrenalin rushing, bludgeoned the head and eyes. When there was nothing left but a sticky, warm pulp she released the gore-covered stone and fell back on her haunches to gather herself. But no sooner did she relax than she heard the rising crescendo of chattering teeth echoing through the darkness.  

With an almost defeated sigh, Haddie staggered to her feet. White fear flashed through her mind as the chattering and hissing grew louder and louder. Teeth clenched as thousands of red eyes flared up in the inky blackness of the cave. She backed away slowly, then spun on her heals and ran!

    "Calm" - Class II

    Felix Richter was born to Janos and Ursula Richter in Coburg, Germany, where the Richter family had deep connections and were among the most respected of its physicians. His parents, both members of an ancient society, were always out of the Richter manor at medical conferences or providing humanitarian aid around the world. Travelling exposed young Felix to new cultures, languages, and architecture unlike anything he had ever seen before. He wasn’t sure when the architectural bug bit, but when it did, it bit hard, and he knew that despite his family’s legacy, he would one day design buildings that would inspire the world. By 23, he was considered an architectural prodigy having won the Swiss Architect Medal and the German National Design Award.  Yet despite his success, Felix couldn’t shake the gnawing feeling that his success had more to do with luck and connections than talent and hard work.<br><br>Growing up, Felix was socially awkward and introverted, preferring his imagination to the company of others. He had few friends so when he wasn't traveling with his parents, Felix was in his father’s library devouring rare books, studying history and architecture, soaking up anything and everything he could on architectural movements throughout the centuries.  His father hoped young Felix would learn to be more outgoing and hired every possible specialist to help improve his social skills. When these efforts failed, he threw in the proverbial towel and figured his son would learn when he was ready. He then joined young Felix in the library, where he helped him build elaborate wooden models of buildings while telling him wild stories about his secret club and their ancient battle against a dark and ominous force. Stories, Felix was sure, his father had made up to make his ‘Imperiatti’ group sound cooler than it actually was.<br><br>Felix sometimes wondered if his design sensibilities came from his summer trips to Dyer Island, a private island that boasted some of the world's finest homes and designs. Every summer, Felix would accompany his parents to the island, where members of The Imperiatti would encourage their children to network and forge lifelong connections. Felix didn’t mingle well with the other teenagers, but he did make four friends who like himself didn’t quite fit the ‘high-society’ mold. They were often ridiculed by other teens and disparagingly called ‘The Pariahs,' a name they liked and gladly adopted. Instead of practicing public speaking and engaging in endless debates, The Pariahs spent most of their time exploring the ruins and mysteries of the island until one of their adventures took a turn for the worse.  

Exploring an abandoned internment camp, they descended into what seemed to be an underground laboratory where they uncovered old, leather journals with illustrations and notes of inhumane experiments conducted on prisoners of the First Opium War held by the British East India Company. As they pushed through a locked door, they found a chamber scattered with human skeletons and dusty vials filled with an unknown serum. Before they could examine the contents, the ground seemed to shake beneath their feet and a hissing sound filled their ears. A strange fog suddenly appeared and giant claws seemed to burst from the ground as dark imagination mingled with reality to terrorize them. Before they understood what was happening, Felix’s father and several other parents came to their rescue, using strange tools and objects to protect them. Felix stared at the scene in shock and disbelief. He wasn’t sure if he was dreaming or living one of his father’s ridiculous, supernatural stories. By the time he realized it wasn’t a dream, it was all over. The Pariahs were safe, but their parents had mysteriously disappeared without a trace.  

After the shock of his father’s disappearance, Felix searched for any theory that could help him understand the phenomena he had encountered on the island. He exchanged notes with The Pariahs and other people he had met online who had also lost loved ones in a similar way. The tragedy had fostered a strong relationship between The Pariahs and for years they worked together to unravel the mystery of what had happened to their parents.  But nothing made sense, and every lead they pursued hit a dead end. With time their efforts dwindled, and the five friends slowly grew apart, each going their separate ways, hoping to forget the nameless darkness that had robbed them of their parents.   

Over the years, Felix proved to be an exceptional architect, though he found little inspiration working for others. He realized his father was right. His lack of social skills was holding him back. With dedication and purpose, he improved his diction and decorum and learned how to network or ‘play-act’ as he liked to call it. He created the perfect façade to make himself more likable and popular with potential clients. After working for several architectural firms, he established his firm with his colleague Lauren Golder. Both shared a similar vision and were philosophically opposed to formulaic modernist buildings, often experimenting with unusual materials, shapes and structures.  

Felix continued to undermine traditional expectations in favor of the edgy and unconventional devices that set the architectural world abuzz. But even with all the accolades, he couldn’t shake the feeling that he was a phony, like an actor who had learned a part instead of a true architect who had inspired the world with an impeccable design. During these moments of insecurity and self-doubt, he would distract himself with endless parties and drown his anxieties in alcohol, wishing his father was still around for some harsh advice and tempered wisdom.<br><br>Eventually, Felix’s girlfriend announced that he was going to be a father. The news shook him to the core and, wanting to inspire his unborn child as much as his father inspired him, he quickly pulled his life together. What he needed was a project that would challenge him and cement his worth as an architect. As fate would have it, the perfect opportunity presented itself when old friends of his father commissioned his firm ‘Richter and Golder’ to build something new and unconventional on Dyer Island. The challenge excited and terrified Felix, who now drowned his anxieties with articles and books on parenting.<br><br>Within six months, the Dyer Restoration Project was underway, and as Felix surveyed the island, he suddenly heard a familiar voice calling out to him from beyond the shattered Victorian buildings and the crumbling ruins hiding dark stories long hidden and forgotten.  Through a strange, gathering fog, he saw a form slowly take shape. His eyes widened, and his lips parted, but no words issued forth. Could it be? Was it possible? No... it couldn’t be... it was... impossible... and yet...<br><br>With dawning realization, Felix staggered back as he watched his father emerge from the fog. His legs felt weak, and his rising heartbeat thrashed in his ears. It was him. It was really him. His unborn child would know his grandfather, and he could finally show him how much he had accomplished since he disappeared. They stared at one another for a long moment. Then his father gave him a look of disappointment, turned his back on him, and proceeded to walk away. Over his pounding heart, Felix chased after him and was never seen again.

    I am taking notes under incredible mental strain. I have had flashes of survivor memories overrun my senses all day, and I am trying to focus on home and gather myself. I haven’t used the Auris for some time and yet I have been pulled in and out of these lives randomly. These records… these archives will, I imagine help me remember myself should this Auris nudge me into the abyss.

    So you tagged their building. Big deal. Means nothing. You got your name out there... that's what you did... but what does that name stand for? Nea doesn't know how to respond to Casey. She's never really attached a message to her street name like others. It's just not something she thought she'd ever do. It's not about a message. It's about art. Casey says art is the message. Art is rebellion. Some call it preaching. Who said that?  Who made that up? The corporations... Nea... of course they did. Get artists scared of using their art, of saying anything against their abuse and they win. Centuries ago artists protested tyrant kings and those tyrants did all they could to own or stifle their art through fear of poverty or fear of death. Nea… kings still exist… they do… just in different ways.  Today the kings are CEOS and their kingdoms are corporations and some are good kings and others... not so good... and the not so good one have found other ways to keep artists in line. Scare them in school. Tell them not to make a statement. Tell them to stand for something. Appeal to all. Just entertain. Entertain and inspire but don't say something.  Don't be political. Nea... everything is political. Not say something is say something. Turning your back and ignoring corruption is a choice, a political choice of indifference. Nea sighs. She doesn't know. She's not sure. She's never really done it before like the others. It always kind of rubbed her the wrong way. Casey scoffs at her tag. Stand up for something or stand for nothing.  Your choice as an artist. Your political choice.

    The Pale Rose, an ancient paddle steamer in the middle of the swamp, is held captive by the stagnant mud. It has been here long before the residents began their hunt, a barely visible silhouette from the nearby village. There are signs of inhabitation, particularly in the upper states room where strange, ritualistic markings in dried blood and dirt cover the floor. From the scale of the bloodletting, something horrid has taken place here.

    King has this way of doing things that are quite amusing. One of my favorite memories I return to time and time again whenever I need a lift is memory 2332. Gasoline Man.  King grabs this man who skipped a few payments on a loan. He drags him by the hair and throws him in an alley. He grabs a metal gasoline container and douses the ‘sod’ with its contents and lights a match. He stares at him through the flickering flame as the man screams in terror. He watches him beg for his life. Then he flings the match. The man’s eyes pop out of his head as the flame hits his chest and falls to the floor with a sizzle. King tells him to make his payment or next time he’ll use real gasoline. Brilliant.

    Village to village it’s always the same scene. Death and destruction. Burnt cars, homes, and bodies. His people disappearing in a seemingly endless mixture of fog and smoke. He can’t move anymore. He doesn’t have the strength or will. The smoke stings his eyes. The stench makes him want to retch with every inhale.  But most of all he can’t take… the silence. The horrible silence. The oppressive, dreadful, indifferent silence. He stops and sits by a tree with a vulture hovering close to him, waiting for him to die. This one wants its meat fresh. Raw. Not burnt or doused in kerosene. He closes his eyes for a moment and drifts away, far away, but soon he hears a voice… a voice like his mother’s… he opens his eyes to see a woman and several muddied children staring at him. The mother extends an open hand. You must come with me. Philip doesn’t answer. He can’t answer. There’s no warmth or wetness in his mouth. His throat is like sand. His eyes are like tar. The woman hands him a flask, and he drinks as though he’s never had water before. She tells him her name is Funanya and that he should come with her. I don’t want to run anymore … I want to die... The mother keeps her hand extended. And that is why you must live… you must live to tell others what happened… to bear witness… Philip stares beyond the woman and fixes his gaze on one boy and two girls. He takes Funanya’s hand and together they trudge into the thick smoke and fog refusing to be disappeared.

    Insidious
    Danny Johnson, known as Jed Olsen by some, grabbed the newspaper from the kitchen counter: it was a week old, but his face was on the front page, grainy and sunken. It was one of those muggy afternoons in Florida when heat and humidity permeated everything in the kitchen, making him sweat while standing still. He slouched in a damp chair to read. This article had better be good—his work in Roseville had been outstanding.<br><br><i><b>GHOST FACE DISAPPEARS</b></i><br><br>June 18, 1993<br><br>At first glance, Jed Olsen was a modest and enthusiastic freelancer with experience in a variety of small newspapers. The staff at the Roseville Gazette appreciated how easy-going and honest he seemed, and so he was treated as a stranger for no more than five minutes into his interview:<br><br>“Jed quickly spotted the editor-in-chief in the room, gave him a wide smile and a firm handshake, and talked about good old American values. And that was it, he was in.”—Ex-Contributor at the Roseville Gazette<br><br>Olsen never justified his erratic career path, which zigzagged between several small towns from Utah to Pennsylvania. There was no verification of his previous jobs. He had a decent portfolio plus a good attitude, and they needed a contributor right away.<br><br><b>THE ROSEVILLE MURDERS</b><br><br>Olsen had been working at the newspaper for five months when the Roseville Murders began: victims from young to old, stabbed to death in their homes. From the reports, the victims seemed chosen at random, yet the killer knew his way around in the houses. The multiple stab wounds indicated a personal motive. No traces of DNA were found. The local police were confounded: the murders were carried with fury akin to a crime of passion yet coldly premeditated.<br><br>The murderer also liked to stalk his targets. Two victims had reported being followed on their way home by a dark figure, a few days prior their death. The killer would follow them from Walleyes, a small bar in Northern Roseville, and snap pictures of them at home, while looking for a way in. He could watch the same victim for weeks, meticulously registering their habits and routines. When he felt the urge to kill, he’d visit the most vulnerable victim on his list, and break inside the house quietly.<br><br>The whole staff worked on the Roseville Murders story. Olsen was often sent to interview the family of victims and relay official statements from the police. Unknown to everyone at the time, his involvement added to the final body count.<br><br><b>THE GHOST FACE</b><br><br>Panic swelled in Roseville when Olsen produced footage of a hooded figure breaking into a house at night. The masked face, a white blur in the dark, stared at the camera for a second, before disappearing inside. “Ghost Face Caught on Tape” was the resulting article, written by Olsen. He seemed proud of his work at the time, enjoying how the whole town feared his ghost stories.<br><br>Weeks later, Olsen left a note on his work desk and disappeared:<br><br>“I hope you liked my stories--I enjoyed bringing them to life. Don’t worry, I'm not done.” –Jed Olsen<br><br>The Roseville law enforcement still refuses to comment as Jed Olsen remains at large. <br><br>Danny smiled, ripping out the article from the newspaper. When the investigation had been pointing to him, he’d packed his bags and left Roseville swiftly.<br><br>He got up, the clammy seat pulling his skin. An oppressive humidity engulfed him as he entered the bedroom. Condensation dribbled on a small misted-up window as bits of cracked wallpaper hung limply. Its floral pattern was covered with gruesome photos and newspaper headlines. Danny pinned the week-old article on top of a picture of lacerated scalps. A faint pang of hunger hit him, and he wondered when he had eaten last. Was it this morning, while washing his knife and clothes? Or was it last night, after following that girl down the street? He couldn’t remember clearly.<br><br>Taking a step back, he admired his work on the wall. His mind drifted, remembering all the articles he’d written, the stories he’d planned, and the scenes he’d brought to life.<br><br>A shiver ran through him. A chilling breeze transformed the bedroom's humidity into an opaque, freezing Fog. A woman shrieked. Dead leaves crunched under his feet.<br><br>He smiled in anticipation.

    Eternal Sorrow
    This is not the Badham Preschool where children laughed and learned, made lifelong friendships and had their paintings hung on the walls. This is a dark echo created from the nightmares of those who suffered there. The walls creak under the burden of history. Events that should be long forgotten are recorded forever in the plaster and stone, pervading the building with misery. Only one part of the building is accurately reflected in this darkness. The squalid room where Freddy Krueger lived and worked. The hidden basement area where he committed the heinous acts that appalled a town and condemned him to death. This is a place of the subconscious, of the nightmare brought into hideous reality.

    Badham Preschool I
    Some civilizations collapse because they discover knowledge they aren’t mature enough to understand. Other civilizations collapse because of natural disasters. And yet other civilizations get a little push… a little nudge… over the cliff. I have studied the final days of countless worlds… been through the memories of so many survivors… and I can say that The Entity doesn’t just corrupt and consume a world… it somehow taps into our collective fears and has a little fun.  From what I’ve observed The Entity seems to take its time cherry-picking souls from a buffet of misery while contemplating a perfect design of destruction as though… as though an apocalypse was a kind of work of art… a kind of masterpiece. This I realize goes against everything I’ve learned about Ancients back home. But I cannot deny that all the stories and memories I’ve been examining suggest a voluntary and not involuntary will to create and destroy on the part of this Ancient. It’s all speculation at this point but the last realm that opened up in the basement allowed me to venture into Terra Arachna where I witnessed the fall of a world to massive, spider-like creatures—monsters that could have only come from The Entity. Not wanting any of those monsters escaping into the tower, I quickly etched a symbol into the basement door to make the realm disappear. Then, just to be certain, I opened the door and all that was left of the apocalypse was a small, empty room covered in dust. But, as I examined the room, I thought I heard a kind of chittering sound in the corridors. I swallowed a growing lump in my throat and cautiously searched the tower to make sure nothing had escaped. I didn’t find anything inside, but noises outside continue to disturb my sleep, and I’m sure I’ve seen things moving in the fog.

    More than love. More than passion. Julie feels Frank is her spiritual twin. She spent the whole night confiding her darkest desires to him. How she often wondered what it would be like to set fire to the entire town. Frank leans forward and tell her she can do anything she wants. She just has to know what she wants and build an image of herself doing what she wants in her mind. He continues to espouse some weed-induced theory about manipulating the world with thoughts and feelings. The clearer you are about what you want and the more focused you are in imagining it the faster you rewire the world to your favor. Everyone stares at Frank for a long dramatic moment. Then they burst out laughing in unison. Let's all just imagine buckets of money. Franks shakes his head. Money is dead on its own. Money doesn't inspire the world. Real passion and emotion does. See yourself doing what it is you want to do for the rest of your life with passion. Be clear and focused and do not waver and watch the world work in your favor. Another silence. Julie smirks. Frank nods seriously. She closes her eyes and imagines herself and her friends turning Ormond into their personal play pen. She opens her eyes.

    It's hard to say what came over me and I can hardly recollect the last few hours perhaps even days. I awoke with several empty whiskey bottles and dead bodies sprawled across the roof. Not too far from the scene was my gory nine iron and a phonograph playing a solemn, French song about life in a city I will never truly know. I turned the bodies over one by one and they vaguely resembled those who had forsaken me to this infernal prison. I must have conjured them and destroyed them in the same evening. But… with a nine iron? I imagined far worse fates for them. I even have a journal devoted to dark and creative ideas on how I might actually one day make them pay for their corruption and impertinence.

    A sporty outfit she found in a trendy store in Hida. She customized the back with her racing gang's logo, Sakura 7.
    Talbot… my name is Talbot. He remembers his name as he stares at nine hooded figures approaching him. He stumbles over a crumbling pillar with strange symbols written in a language he half-remembers. He remembers the school, the secret school, and the mystics and the arcane knowledge they were protecting. He was getting too close and he wasn't ready. Humanity wasn't ready. Knowledge without wisdom leads to self-destruction. He doesn't care about any of that. You condemned me! You all condemned me! Left me to wither away! A hooded figure approaches him. You condemned yourself, Talbot! You condemned yourself… The nine hooded figures disappear as a massive dragon bursts through the ground and peers down at him with dead, black eyes. The hideousness of its face transcends anything he's ever read about, seen or imagined. An ancient evil quickened with dark life! Talbot trembles in a fog of madness that envelops him. The ancient beast lashes out at him, snatches him in its talons and swallows him whole.  Mingled saliva and acid rips through his tunic and burns his skin to the bone. With screams of agony he slowly disintegrates in a belly full of putrid, rotting death, watching his body and limbs melt into a gory endless mass.
    Something, or someone, grew within her, its bones protruding, limbs reaching for freedom from the prison of flesh.

    Pam begs for another symbol or charm to help her on a test she isn’t ready for with a teacher she despises. A teacher she ridicules for being an overweight, pill-popping bore. Lisa refuses to entertain the idea and tells her she’s not allowed to look at her grandmother’s secret book let alone share its contents with strangers. Pam shrugs and proceeds to scratch a symbol on her arm with a toothpick. She asks if Lisa heard what happened to the woman near the school. Lisa shakes her head. Pam laughs as she draws blood with the toothpick. Dumb ass walked into the street while reading and splat! Crushed by a truck! Come! She flicks the toothpick to the ground, grabs Lisa’s wrist and leads her to a road a few blocks from the school. Lisa covers her nose and can smell the fermenting human fluids in the cracks of the pavement. Pam points out blood stains and clumps of hair in the road and makes jokes at the dead girl’s expense. Lisa grabs her wrist angrily. You mustn’t laugh at the dead. Pam yanks her wrist away. Stop being creepy, Lisa. It’s not like she’s still around to get offended… besides… your symbols got me covered with all kinds of luck.  Lisa stares at Pam’s arm with concern and hopes the dead girl’s spirit didn’t take offense. Her grandmother says sometimes spirits linger, especially when they don’t want to be dead. Last thing she needs is some dark force following her for the rest of her life.
    Come with me. Casey jumps on her board and leads Nea into The Narrows. She leads her to a home where a father helps his son eat food in his bed. He's only eleven. Never had a chance. The only mistake was trusting those who were supposed to protect him. He's dying. Mercury poisoning. Before people in The Narrows died of natural causes… now it's all mercury poisoning. Casey sighs and shakes her head. You sign your tag over the culprit's garage door and all you've done is advertise your street name. I heard your bullshit about not using your tag for a cause. What's the use of a tag then? What the use of a voice if you ain't gonna say anything? Ain't gonna stand up for something. Art is an act of defiance. Not an act of profit. Not an act of fame. Say something, Nea. Let the world know what's in your heart. Someone just might listen and do something. Lend your voice to the voiceless. Not rebel without a cause. Rebel with a cause.

    I hate the smell of kerosene. Funanya nods and agrees with Philip. It’s not the kerosene but everything else attached to it. Nikki looks at Funanya and asks why the crews are burning everything. Funanya doesn’t answer and maybe she doesn’t know. Philip turns to her. They are burning evidence. Nikki and Chika look to Funanya, and she nods. Philip hears his grandmother’s voice. Death plus destruction equals good business for devils disguised as humans. Philp grinds his teeth and answers the disembodied voice. They should all be killed… those who pay for murder and those who profit from murder…Funanya stares at him. Philip… don’t say such things… they are trying to take our humanity from us and that is the one thing they cannot take unless we give it to them.  

Philip feels his face harden. I don’t want a sermon. I want my family back. I want them to pay for what they did.  Funanya puts a hand on his shoulder. Pray to the angel of mercy that we survive so that we may bear witness. Philip stares past her at the growing night. I’d rather pray to the angel of death and watch them suffer. Forgive, and be forgiven. I can’t! I hate them! How can they take money to do such things? There will be justice, Philip. They will not get away with their crimes. Philip doesn’t say anything. He doesn’t say anything because like his father he believes that those with money, those who can afford killing crews and the quantities of kerosene required to burn humans by the thousands, can get away with any crime they choose to commit--even mass murder. She can pray for mercy all she likes. He’d rather pray for vengeance.

    Yun holds the sampler as if it's dripping blood. The only solace in Ji-Woon's mind is that she doesn't understand what it really is. He knows her. If she thought the sounds were actual murders, she'd have tried to knee him in the crotch and run. But the anger still rattles through her, as she moves up to his face.<br><br>What is this twisted horror bullshit? What if this leaked? You're already attracting crazed, violent fans, how would it look if the media heard the demented sounds you're working on? Mightee One would drop you. Your career would be dead.<br><br>Ji-Woon knows what she really fears: her career would be dead. For as tall as she stands, as strong as she swings, she's nothing but a scared girl afraid of failure. He knows how to play her. Drops his head, breathes deeply, wipes the back of his hand over his eyes.<br><br>Yun... Ever since the death of No Spin... the fire... I'm riddled with horrid thoughts. I lost my friends and... I fear I'm losing my mind. I see awful things behind closed eyes. All that guides me through the dark fog is turning my pain into sound... pouring the throes of death from my heart to a song.<br><br>Yun's face softens. She sits. Commiserates with him. Inside, he's reliving the divine screams of his bandmates as they burned, his swelling heart as they screamed his name, but on his face he shows nothing but contortions of tragedy.<br><br>She excuses his error in judgment. Confiscates the sampler. Requests he stay on hotel grounds until the concert is over. It's for his own good. His safety. She tells him to get a drink from the mini-bar and cool down.<br><br>He quietly nods and complies, reminding himself to steal back the sampler in a few days. He lets her pretend she has what he's holding: control.

Not once. Not twice. Thrice. The boys continue to stare at her openmouthed. Something is changing in Janitor-Yamaoka. They know it. She knows it. She feels the waking dragon in her heart. It's the closest she's ever felt to being… a fighter… a warrior… a Yamaoka... and she likes it... likes being treated with respect… likes being taken seriously. For an instant she imagines herself beside the great Renjiro Yamaoka and his son Kazan. Something tugs in her heart and the dragon stirs… and the dragon… she realizes… is the waking of her raging Yamaoka blood.

    The atmosphere of the realms is dark and grim to say the least but also… everchanging. I've already remarked that the atmosphere is misty even foggy at times and that this fog feels alive. It seems to contain swirls and streams of memories or imprints of beings from multiple terra worlds. It is as if The Entity absorbs all the psychic energy and thoughts of beings it snatches as it journeys through the endless cosmos.<br><br>I've used the Auris to study the black fog and have come to three observations that will prove invaluable to finding a way home. First, the fog is rich in Auric particles leading me to believe this dimension is more conscious than it is material. Second, I should be able to manifest anything I am able to pull from rifts in the fog using techniques passed down from my family. Third… The Entity is far more ancient than we ever suspected back home and most of our theories and conjectures were wrong. The rich presence of Auric particles and cells suggest it is one of the Original Ones—an Ancient.

    Sally makes no attempt to suppress her disgust as she looks at the Broken Woman's smile. You would criticize your fellow patients for bringing nothing to this world, yet what have you provided? The Broken Woman awkwardly sits up on her bed, pulling at her restraints like a restless marionette. I have provided more to this world than a thousand missionaries. When I saw sickness, I did not coddle it, feed it, wipe the tears from its eyes—I cleansed it! The Broken Woman sees she has Sally's attention. If we want humanity to survive, we must be its custodians, sweet nurse. And yet... we have allowed an infection to fester—the evidence pervading these walls. The Broken Woman pauses, allowing her point to settle. Shrieks and moans from the mentally insane echo through the halls.<br><br>Sally feels her nerves tighten with each chaotic noise that comes her way. She has little desire to argue, yet duty compels. Are you not within these walls too? Would that not make you part of the infection? The Broken Woman smiles as if expecting this question. I am the solution, condemned to the halls of the infected. Like you, I was a nurse. But I served not the patients but the greater good. With one simple injection I removed the weak from the gene pool. I watched them in their death throes, knowing my actions were backed by honest science so few have the strength to trust. And do you know what the courts called me for following logic? Insane!

    The man with the moustache is huddled in the corner of Jeffrey’s trailer. Babbling, crying, pleading his case. Jeffrey isn’t listening. All he sees is the finger... and the puddle at Moustache’s feet. Jeffrey knows what it means. The man's realized he has one chance at survival, and his fight or flight just kicked in. But Jeffrey doesn’t care, he knows he’s already won. The Finger of Chaos is as good as his. The memories of his father are already shifting. A large, horrible man towering above, bellowing—no, that isn’t it. Think, Jeffrey. A weak, slouching alcoholic, stammering and slurring, too pathetic to control him. The outburts? Nothing but the fury of a coward, the parody of a powerful man—a joke!<br><br>Moustache jumps up, reaches for the bottles of chemicals on the counter. Predictable. Jeffrey bellows laughter as he grabs the man’s neck and slams him to the floor. Puts his full weight onto Moustache, grips his throat and squeezes. You want to play with chemicals, do ya? I don’t even know what'd happen if those mixed. Hallucinations... euphoria... uncontrolled flatulence... death? Jeffrey thinks this over as he repeatedly smacks Moustache’s head into the floor. They all sound like hilarious endings. And why not add some uncertainty to the mix? He doesn’t need to fear chaos anymore. He can handle it. And hell, he deserves a little fun.<br><br>You want to play one last game? Okay, Moustache... let’s play.

    The tower is alive. I have memories of what the tower was the night before and it changes the next day. It changes in ways that defy reason or anything we've come to know about the ontology of these Ancients back home. It's entirely possible that if you were to understand all that this place is that you would go insane. I opened the door to what I thought would be an empty room covered in dust, only to discover an entire city with skyscrapers and ancient pagodas. Bewildered, I stared among the ruins of the street at a group of teenagers cutting down massive, mutant bug-like creatures with deadly samurai swords. I quickly closed the door and opened it again to find the city was gone. It had completely disappeared. Nothing there but a small dusty room with a strange-looking spider crawling toward me. I crushed the spider under the heel of my boot and didn't even attempt to understand what had just transpired.

    Music blares. Eyes are kept forced open with toothpicks. Carter piggybacks a looping song with an inaudible subliminal frequency to evoke fear, anxiety and discontent. He experimented with the loop on his parents. Always caused a fight between them. He doesn’t remember where he got the loop. He first read about the subliminal frequency from advertisers. Advertisers deny subliminal loops work. Of course, they do. Advertisers deny they use subliminal loops. But… they do. They use them, and they work. They must. They must because peace and contentment is our natural disposition. War and discontent needs to be instilled, enforced, manufactured, repeated over and over again until it’s the main script in the collective consciousness.<br><br>PAPERCLIP. BLUEBIRD. MKULTRA. MKDELTA. MKSEARCH. They were all necessary. Lord Crag had the right idea. Good instincts. So did the Black Sorcerer and the Dirty Trickster. They inspired all the goodies he brought with him in his bag. Music. Drinks. Drugs. Lots of drugs. For a moment just a moment he hesitates. He’ll probably go to jail for a long time if he uses his goodies. But… being free… being truly free for a few days… is worth a lifetime of imprisonment. But I won’t get caught. Good-doctor will.

    The doctor tells Meg her foot is fractured in several places and she should probably stay off it until it heals. She shambles out of the office on crutches with her mother by her side. Meg can sense she’s worried about her and how she’s to settle the bill without insurance. They drive home in silence. Mom… I’m sorry. Meg breaks the silence. Her mother shakes her head. Don’t apologize, Meg. No need for that, I’m just glad you’re okay… Could have been a lot worse. Meg nods and replays the assault over and over again in her mind. The push. The kick. The stomping. Nothing about what happened makes sense. The perpetrator didn’t mug or try to steal anything from her. Meg’s mother breaks the silence and asks if she remembers anything about the man since they spoke to the police. Meg shakes her head. I’m not even sure it was a man.

    Okinawan Blade (Frozen)
    Chamber of Blood. Harbinger of Hell. Beneath the Ruins 4.<br><br>As the creature prepared to quench its thirst, Haddie felt the end coming. Desperate hands fumbled over dirt and twigs, searching for something, anything. Then, just as the creature prepared to puncture her neck, she grabbed a rock the size of a baseball and smashed it straight through its mouth, shattering its deadly fangs.  

The creature jolted to its feet with mad agony. Pieces of bone and tooth dropped into a thick puddle of blood and saliva. Haddie turned to see Jordan moaning. He was alive, barely, nevertheless alive. Relieved, she scrambled to her feet, trying to think of a way to destroy this ancient evil once and for all.  Then she saw it— 

The revolver!  

Hanging from the belt! 

Without hesitation, she rushed up to the creature as two new white fangs pushed out the bloody remnants of the old.  Before it realized what was happening, she snatched the revolver and shot the creature point-blank in the face.   

The creature fell head over heels as Haddie unloaded the revolver into its face and body. But bullets were futile against this otherworldly apparition. Within moments the creature was clambering to its feet the whole while staring at Haddie with blood-red eyes. Nervously, she inched backward, not knowing where to go or what to do. There was nowhere to go.  Nothing she could do. This was the end. 

With incredible speed and strength, the creature pounced and took Haddie to the ground. Gleaming white fangs approached her neck with malice. She jerked and kicked and screamed under its weight. She felt its warm breath inches away from the nape of her neck. Then, in her mind's eye she saw them again.  

The symbols.  

All of them.  

They swirled and flashed and then coalesced into one symbol—the symbol she had seen etched in the casket. With dawning realization, she understood. The symbol wasn't a warning but a seal—a seal to imprison this unfathomable, indescribable creature.  

As the creature prepared to gorge on her life, she managed to grab something sharp off the ground— 

Its broken fang! 

And with the last of her strength, she managed to etch the crescent and the three dots deep into its cheek.  

Suddenly, the creature's eyes widened into great big pools of disbelief. It looked at Haddie in abject terror as it stumbled backward, desperately trying to scratch the symbol off its ghastly face.   

But it was too late.  

Black mist like acid bubbled and burned through the creature's skin. The percolating mist filled its lungs, chest and neck. The belly and chest ballooned as pressure bludgeoned the creature from within. Then, with an agonized shriek, it exploded like a cherry bomb.  

Covered in gore, Haddie dragged herself beside her rousing brother. 

"What did I miss?" he groaned and sat up, leaning against the tree. He narrowed his gaze and peered through the thin red mist of blood that hung heavy in the air. "Where's the—"  

His voice trailed away as he noticed the shards of bone and chunks of flesh covering his clothes.  In silence, they picked off bits and pieces of the creature. Then Jordan broke the silence, saying, "Well… this was pleasant…  pleasant as a funeral."  

Haddie didn't respond to his stupidity. She was thinking about the symbols they had come across in their investigations.  She wondered what they meant, where they came from, and if there was something connecting all these paranormal sites they were being sent to investigate. Moreover, she wondered if their benefactor was using them in some kind of chess game against forces unknown.
    The face that was once there had been reduced to skin clinging onto jagged, broken bone.

    When the Killer gets too close, it's time to run! Here are some things to keep in mind about chases:<br><br><b>Killer Speed:</b> Most Killers are faster than Survivors, and in long chases they will gain even more speed due to <b>Bloodlust</b> <i>(consult the status effect section of this guide for more details about Bloodlust)</i>.<br><br><b>Vaults:</b> Survivors can vault over windows and pallets very quickly. Killers traverse these obstacles slowly, so they can be used by Survivors to gain distance.<br><br><b>Break line of sight:</b> To survive a chase, a Survivor should try to break line of sight and head in a direction the Killer does not expect or cannot anticipate.<br><br><b>Pallets:</b> Pallets are objects the Survivors can throw down in order to put an obstacle between themselves and the Killer. Killers can be stunned by dropping a pallet on them directly. Pallets can only be dropped once, after which they can be vaulted by Survivors or destroyed by Killers.<br><br>Keeping these points in mind will help you make it out of the chase alive.

    Pam’s English teacher died of unknown causes and Pam’s dancing with joy, relieved she doesn’t have to do his stupid test on some irrelevant dead author. I don’t care what English teachers say, James is unreadable and confusing--a pseudo-intellectual who kept everything vague because he didn’t actually know what the hell he was talking about. Lisa shrugs, disagrees, but doesn’t want to get into it with her friend—her annoying friend. She likes his books, the way his style allows her to live in his character’s head for a little while. She finds his novel about an artist to be a fun, formless, dream-like stew with plenty of style and substance. But what does she know, she’s only sixteen, and her English marks are below average. Pam hoots and hollers, and with a mischievous smile, she reveals a hand covered with ink-smudged, symbols. Best luck in the world! No test! No lard ass! No dead authors for the rest of the year! Thanks, Lisa! Lisa stares at the symbols on her hand and wants to yell at her for being so careless with things they both don’t fully understand. She closes her eyes and hopes her English teacher wants to be dead and that he isn’t lurking about.

    Jane Romero was the daughter of famous actress, Loretta Lawrence, of whom she had no memory. Her parents had separated when she was still a baby, mainly since her mother was often away filming. Jane was raised by her father, a struggling visual artist. She grew up torn between resenting her mother’s absence from her life and admiring her presence on screen.<br><br>As a teenager, Jane secretly wished to emulate her mother’s talent. She would direct and perform in plays, audition for TV commercials and help her father at his studio. During her senior year, she entered a national oratory contest and won first prize. Her performance attracted the attention of a radio-station that contacted her for an interview. During the live show, her natural charm and repartee impressed the staff, who offered her a part-time job at the station.<br><br>After graduating college in Communication, she quit her job at the station to work for a trendy variety show. But her frank delivery and ad-libs were not appreciated by the show’s executives, who fired her after five months. Desperate for another opportunity, Jane pitched a show at the radio-station she used to work at, only to be turned down, her proposal being <i>too risky</i>.<br><br>Four months later, she received a phone call from a producer who had seen reruns of the show. He was looking for a co-host to spark up the failing show, <i>Quick Talk</i>.<br><br>Live television meant long hours, a low salary, and no stability, but it also offered a platform to broadcast her views. She disputed the crude inflammatory tone of <i>Quick Talk</i> and pushed for a relatable coverage of personal issues. Her honest delivery resonated with her audience and within weeks, the show’s viewership was steadily growing.<br><br>After two years, she launched a full-hour segment called <i>The Jane Romero Show</i>, which was broadcast nationally and covered tabooed topics, including her personal struggle with abandonment. Her show broke records and her initials J.R. became synonymous with products ranging from beauty creams to fashion accessories.<br><br>But Jane needed more; she wanted others to follow in her footsteps. She published a memoir that covered her childhood with an absent mother. Her book was an instant best seller but was reviewed harshly. Critics called it <i>a serving of sad anecdotes seasoned with bland, generic self-help tips</i>. Jane took this criticism to heart, since despite her success, a voice in the back of her mind was starting to doubt her achievements.<br>Her success also generated an increasingly demanding schedule and a growing pressure to entertain constantly. During a particularly tense week, she canned an episode and instead launched a two-hour-long special on divorce. Her stress peaked when she learned that her mother had agreed to star in her show.<br><br>Jane put on a brave face and began the show. Most of it went without a hitch, but when her mother walked on set, smiling warmly at the audience, Jane’s stomach lurched unpleasantly. She was consumed by a violent envy that had been festering. Yet she carried on with a strained smile, until Loretta interrupted her, saying that they were not actually related. The interview went haywire after that.<br><br>After the show, Jane was driving to her father’s house in New Jersey. She needed to talk things over with him; she had not been feeling like herself lately. She turned on a freeway along the coast to avoid major congestion and popped some pain killers to numb the throbbing pain in her temples, which had been nagging her all day. Then she started to relax and turned on the radio; classical music was playing. The drive was slow. Black ice covered the highway, which was packed with cars on their way back home. Night fell. A darkness began to blur the corners of her vision and turned the headlights into swirls of red. Jane blinked to sharpen their outlines, but each time she closed her eyes, her eyelids became heavier and slower, until they remained shut, for a moment too long.<br><br>The following morning, authorities were fishing out Jane’s car from the water. Despite leading a meticulous search for weeks, they were unable to retrieve her body.<br><br>The airing and production of <i>The Jane Romero Show</i> was suspended until after her funeral, which her father and mother attended.<br><br>As the public grieved for Jane, there was a surge of orders for J.R. products and all her episodes were re-released a month later, with an opening credit that wished her eternal peace.
    Engines rattle and roar in an endless cacophony as Shinji messes with Yui. Everyone wants the jackpot, and she needs this money more than ever. She's been working as an assistant English teacher at a high school but it's barely enough to get by let alone fix her bike. Her bike... her bike feels sick. She used to love the sound of her bike but recently she's noticed a change, a few notes are off, and the sound just doesn't travel through her body the way it used to. All these engines singing their unique song and her bike singing something strange and off. She needs the prize money, and the sponsorship of a billionaire wouldn't be so bad either. Last thing she'll do is let this fool disrupt her focus. She smiles at him after he levels an insult at her and threatens to run her off the road. Yui meets his gaze. You'll try, but you'll crash and burn just as soon as you do. She says it with the weight and certainty of a curse. Shinji tells her she should stay out of this one and let the men race. She knows what he trying to do. He's trying to disrupt her. Get in her head. Change the vision of victory in her mind. He tells her the race is his. She flashes a smile. Not while I'm alive.

    The Day of Virtue arrives, a monthly ceremony to purify the congregation of dire sins. A bell tolls. Adiris and the rest of the temple's crowd drop to their knees. Forehead touches cold stone. She peeks up, sees the Maiden Guard arrive, stepping through the crowd, guided by faith to seek out sinners. She waits, counts the scratches in the floor until—a scream. A woman pleads and... coughing, choking. Adiris looks up, sees a commoner dragged from the temple by her throat. She hardly notices two olive-brown feet step in front of her. Rise. Rise! Adiris shrinks under the Maiden's gaze, notices the hint of ripened dates from her open mouth. Under the eyes of the sea goat, speak of the evil you have witnessed. Deliver us thieves, adulterers, and blasphemers, so we may purge them. Shoulders stiffen. Adiris sees the face of Haban, the face of the man who raised her. She hears his gentle voice... and the agitated voice of a blasphemer. Indecision knots in her chest, tightening, twisting.<br><br>I have witnessed... no evil. By the gods, my eyes are pure. The Maiden examines Adiris. Seconds trickle by, ever-slowing, stretching reality to its seams, until—the Maiden nods. May you swim through sea and stars. She turns away, and Adiris summons every bit of strength to keep herself from collapsing.

    Autohaven Wreckers
    THE SHOWMAN
    Swing Chains
    A pair of conjoined twins, Charlotte and Victor Deshayes formed an emotional bond like none other. The unlikeliness of their successful birth in the 17th century could be described as miraculous, yet it immediately brought about their life of persecution. The twins emerged with Victor’s lower body affixed into the chest of his sister, legs twisted around her muscles and organs. He was smaller than Charlotte, grown as if he were an appendage of her body rather than a fully formed boy. As the newborns screeched, so too did the midwife who delivered them, running from the home, yelling of a demon birthed by a witch. So began the hunting of Charlotte, Victor, and their mother Madeleine.<br><br>The coming years were fleeting memories for the twins, yet they were the closest thing to a normal life they would know. The journey with their mother was what they believed all children underwent, the games of running and hiding through France’s countryside being an ordinary occurrence. At the age of five, a new challenge to the game was presented as their mother fell ill. Pale and exhausted, Madeleine had no choice but to pass responsibility of collecting food onto Charlotte. The girl, burdened under extra clothing that concealed Victor’s protruding body, set out from their forest tent and marched to the nearby town. Though a peculiar sight, she did what she had been trained for, waiting for an opening at the market and swiping whatever food she could. It was a victory in the game, but one short-lived.<br><br>After midnight, glowing flames surrounded the family’s encampment, bobbing through the darkness. A single commanding shout broke the night’s silence and a mob of witch hunters streamed in. Grubby hands tore the twins from their bed, Charlotte frantically kicking all who approached. Madeleine cried for her children, her voice abruptly silenced by a club to her skull. Victor shrieked, the wailings of a trapped rat.<br><br>The hunters coordinated quickly. A judge on hand declared Madeleine guilty of witchcraft, evidenced by her demon spawn. Within minutes, they shackled her unconscious body to a tree, surrounding her feet with dry twigs and moss. As she awoke, she did not struggle, only begged her children to turn away. They would be given no choice. The twins were forced to watch as the torch was lit, and they watched as flames leapt up their mother’s skirt, charring and sizzling her flesh. They watched as fat dripped from her body, and her face bubbled and twisted. They watched until the screams that tore her vocal cords were no more, and all that was left was the crackling of embers and a nauseating stench.<br><br>Whatever joy and goodness were in them died with their mother. Caged and transported to an old wooden temple, they were sold to a secretive group clad in dark cloaks. Victor reacted with the ferocity of a rabid beast at any who approached, clawing and biting. The only solace that could calm him was the embrace of his sister. Charlotte, bitter and hateful to all but her brother, found purpose in being his protector.<br><br>Within the temple, they were exposed to unusual experiments for years—some cruel, many simply baffling. One day they would be made to break the neck of a small grey bird. The next, they would bleed their fingers into a vase of roses. Every seventh day, they would sleep with the branch of a damp oak beneath their pillow. Then there was the chanting: a never-ending chorus from cloaked figures on scheduled intervals. <br><br>In time, a final experiment was planned. Two robed figures herded the twins to the center of the temple, holding Charlotte upon an altar in a room alit with candelabras. The wrinkled face of a man peered from under his hood, placing a hand on the forehead of each twin, making careful examination of their skulls. Memento mori, he uttered, as he withdrew a shining blade.<br><br>Charlotte rolled to her side, shifting her brother off the altar. With a screech, he stretched his arm as far as he could, knocking a candelabra to the ground. The flames took to the dry wood immediately. They swept over the floor, igniting the black robes that brushed against it. Screams of agony pierced the chaos, invigorating Charlotte. She dashed through the inferno, vision concealed with nothing but black smoke and blazing flame. A painful heaviness filled her lungs. No exit could be found, every step leading to overwhelming heat. She fell to her knees, suffocating, and then saw it—sunlight, trees. She stumbled from the fire into dewy grass. Without looking back, she ran into the forest until she collapsed.<br><br>When Charlotte opened her eyes, she reached for Victor’s hand. He made no attempt to budge. His body hung helplessly from her torso. She clasped his face, stared into his sad, still eyes. The movements she was accustomed to—his body pulling at her skin, his legs prodding at the cavity in her chest—were no more. Victor was dead.<br><br>Charlotte had no choice but to continue moving as she mourned, fearing black cloaks and witch hunters were prowling. She concealed her brother’s corpse under her clothing and marched for the sewers of a nearby city. There, she set up camp, emerging often to steal whatever food she could, resorting to raiding barns for pig slop when desperation set in. Throughout the years, Victor’s corpse rotted as his limbs oozed and blackened, yet his body demonstrated resistance to complete decomposition, as if his sister’s blood still coursed through him. Protecting his lifeless body became Charlotte’s sole reason for being, refusing to ever be separated from the only family she had left.<br><br>Life in her teenage years was a game of survival. Her hatred for humanity grew each day under the realization they would never leave her be. No matter how many died during her botched robberies and desperate attempts to escape, there would always be more to pursue and sling words of condemnation at her—monster, demon, witch. And it was the black cloaks who were the worst of them. Their hunt for her was unending, forcing her to constantly abandon shelter and run.<br><br>For years, Charlotte fled, drawing blood out of necessity, cradling her long-dead brother in the night. During a frigid winter, her body began to break down. Food was scarce and the refuge of rickety shacks were no use against freezing temperatures. Sickle in hand, she sheltered near her campfire in the woods, not knowing if the black cloaks would take her before the cold did. As frost crystalized around her nostrils and her lips took on a gentle blue hue, Charlotte felt something she had never experienced: acceptance. She closed her eyes, opening herself to the serenity of death when—a shriek, shrill and vicious pierced her ears. Victor spasmed and flailed from her chest, a cloud of fog encompassing him. Before she could react, he spilled from her in a bloody puddle, landing on the snow and running.<br><br>Pulling herself from the edge of death, she gave chase. Calling his name, she ran through the forest until her legs could hardly carry her, until finally, within her view, was Victor, sitting at the edge of a thick fog. His face, twisted and feral, screamed as a dark hooded figure emerged from the fog, grabbed his arm, and seized him. The serenity that had crept into Charlotte was extinguished, replaced with the seething hatred and rage she had depended on for so long. With a tight grip on her sickle, she charged into the fog, prepared to eviscerate any who set foot near her brother.

    An early settlement on the unforgiving frontier, the outpost of Glenvale was snuffed out in a ruthless, bloody gang war. Responding to the abduction of five brothers-in-arms, the Hellshire Gang stormed in with six-shooters and dynamite. What began as a standoff with the Mason Kelly Gang quickly broke down into a chaotic war zone. Guns fired indiscriminately in a desperate bid for self-preservation, cutting through gang members and civilians alike.<br><br>When the dust settled, the dead outnumbered the living. The hostages were discovered to have been long killed, their bodies disemboweled, guts strewn across town. In a silent rage, the few surviving Hellshire members rounded up their injured enemies and finished them in the same gruesome manner. By nightfall, only the crows remained, feasting gluttonously upon their victory.

    The class is at the funeral out of respect for their beloved English teacher. The pallbearers struggle and strain under the weight of the coffin. Pam leans toward Lisa and whispers how lucky she is and how unlucky the poor pallbearers are to have to lift such a heavy coffin. Imagine having to carry that lard-ass to his grave. Lisa nudges Pam and tells her to quit it. As the pallbearers approach them she feels a sudden tug in her gut. An instinct tells her to take some distance from her friend. An image of lightning striking Pam flashes through her mind. She wonders if an angry spirit could make that happen. Every muscle, organ, vessel, fried in an instant for her hubris. Pam snaps Lisa out of her thoughts with another tactless comment. Lisa hears her grandmother’s voice in her head telling her that her friend has tempted fate by laughing at someone else’s misfortune. For having laughed at the dead. She doesn’t really believe in all her grandmother’s superstitions… and yet… she inches away from her friend, staring at the darkening clouds, waiting for lightning to strike Pam down.

    The ultimate goal of the Killer is to sacrifice Survivors to The Entity. Once a Survivor is hung on a sacrificial hook, the sacrifice sequence will begin. It has 3 phases.<br><br><b>Phase 1: Summoning Phase</b><br>In this phase, The Entity is being summoned to the hook and takes some time to manifest. Hooked Survivors can be rescued or attempt to free themselves from the hook. These attempts have a 4% chance of success, and failure accelerates the summoning process.<br><br><b>Phase 2: Struggle Phase</b><br>Once The Entity has manifested itself around the hook, Survivors can no longer attempt to free themselves. They can only fight to survive. They may still be rescued by other Survivors.<br><br><b>Phase 3: Sacrifice Phase</b><br>The Entity will eventually overpower a hooked Survivor and devour them. The hook itself is destroyed at the end of the sacrifice sequence.<br><br>A Survivor who is rescued or escapes from the hook will progress to the next phase the next time they are hooked. For example, a Survivor who was freed in the summoning phase will progress immediately to the struggle phase the next time they are hooked. A Survivor who was freed during the the struggle phase and hooked again will be immediately sacrificed.

She rolls a wooden die, moves a black disc over the board's squares, lands on Haban's piece, places it to the side. No reaction from Haban. Adiris looks to him, sweet expression of concern. A joyous sacrifice this morning, would you say? The gods rejoice, praise be. Haban hardly lifts an eye. Mhmm... praise be. A cool breeze, birds chirp, unseen. Haban seems to scan the courtyard. Upon seeing no other occupants, looks Adiris in the eyes. He was a good man. A friend. And the world is darker without—<br><br>Adiris wonders if she’s being tested. She knows what to say, interrupts him with the line that’s been delivered to her thousands of times before: It was commanded by the gods; he swims in the wake of the sea goat now. Haban turns his attention to the game board, flicks away Adiris' disc and positions his at the end. It seems I have won... as was commanded by the gods. Adiris pushes her chair back, objecting. Haban sweeps the board off the table. I shall write the rules of Ur anew. I shall include decrees, punishment, theft, and sacrifice. And should anyone object, I shall preach those momentous words: It was commanded by the bloody sea goat and his damned gods. Adiris shakes her head, the shock of words she never thought she’d hear rattling painfully in her mind. This is... blasphemy! Deep bags under Haban's eyes seem to swell. Yes, the truth often is.

He probably couldn't tell the difference if he had a lump in each hand. He squeezes and likes the feeling. It soothes him, calms him, relieves his anxiety. His thoughts wander to his favorite TV shows. Ma and Pa let him have a TV to shut him up.  They got tired of him smashing the wall and crying for them. Nothing worked. Not the gag or the rope that he always managed to get out of. Only the TV. TV was better than any constraint. It kept him sitting down, passive, complacent and quiet. Ma said it hypnotized him and that was a good thing.  
The TV showed Boy so many things. Showed him how different his life was from other children. Showed him what parents should have been like. He wishes his parents were more like Clark's parents. They made a hero out of their son just by being good to him and raising him right. They took good care of him and he wasn't even theirs. Or... the other parents... the parents of that other boy, Beaver. He had a good family. But he wasn't like them. He wasn't like Clark or Beaver. He came into the world hurt, deformed and weak like a runt. His Pa told him he had wanted to stuff him in a bag with rocks and throw him in the lake. Tough love. Tough life. Tough everything.  
He hears deputies shouting in the distance. Boy feels scared and does what he usually does in his brick cell. He closes his eyes and thinks of Clark and waits for the greatest of all heroes to save him. He never comes and it's not like TV. He's always there to save the day. He's always there to help those who need help. But TV ain't reality and he's alone. He's alone because he was born a crooked little beast. Boy opens his eyes and stares at the gory lump in his hand. Doesn't matter. Enough waiting. He's own kind of hero today.

    Ace Visconti is one charming guy. With his sharp Italian looks, grey-streaked hair and silver tongue, he could pass for an aging 50s movie star. <br><br>His heart has always belonged to the cards. From his roots as a poor boy in Argentina, he gamed, scammed, seduced and smooth-talked his way to a life of luxury as a high roller in the land of opportunity. Despite money always having a way of slipping through his fingers, Ace always figured he could win more. <br><br>He never fulfilled that ambition; eventually he racked up too many debts with the wrong kind of people. And when they finally came to collect, Ace was nowhere to be found. No one knew who tipped him off or where he fled to, but anyone who knew Ace Visconti can agree on one thing. He will survive: against all odds.

    Bullets discharged from a flashing muzzle in the living room as Haddie followed her brother into the basement of the house. They stumbled down the stairs into the darkness and through a beam of sunlight pouring through a rectangular window. Before they could hide, the assassin was already descending the stairs with his rifle trained on them. Haddie and Jordan held hands and closed their eyes waiting for a quick death. A loud report sounded and when they opened their eyes they were both still standing.  

The assassin stared at them with big white eyes of disbelief, then he collapsed to reveal Surin holding a smoking revolver. “Come on,” he said. “We need to leave before others come.”  

The siblings didn’t hesitate, following Surin up the stairs and out the door past several dead bodies. Haddie counted seven dead assassins by the time she followed her brother into an unmarked black sedan. With a great sense of urgency, Surin started the engine, hit the accelerator and the car peeled away. After a silence, Haddie asked, “Is any of it true? The rumors? Worlds intersecting? The Overlap?”  

Surin didn’t take his eyes off the road as he drove them back to the hotel where their uncle was waiting for them. “I can’t really answer that right now and you need to focus on your next episode. You’re here to investigate the old, abandoned subway station, and I think you should stick to the agenda.”  

“Is it an Overlap?” Jordan asked. “Is that why there were so many accidents? Is that why it was abandoned?”   

Surin hesitated, then nodded gravely.  

“What do you and a billionaire care about the old, subway?” Haddie asked.  

Surin sighed, took a moment to find his words, then answered. “I’m looking for my colleagues. We explored these areas all over the world and a few of us never returned and those that did… they came back to us... lost... confused... insane, even. I want answers. I want to know what happened to the others. I know they’re still alive. They’re lost somewhere... between worlds.”  

“So you’re using us to find them?” Haddie said flatly.  

“We’re helping each other in mutually beneficial ways.”  

Haddie shook her head. “I need to know more. That’s not enough for me.”  

Surin sighed and pulled the sedan over to the shoulder of the road and killed the engine. After a long thoughtful moment, he looked at the siblings in the rear-view mirror and said, “I was undergoing some, let’s say, unorthodox training to enter The Overlap… but it wasn’t possible… it’s like an impossible energy that pulls… I don’t know… hell... pulls hell right out of you… I mean there’s no other way to describe it. What you feel is just pure darkness. But the OSO figured when the mind is developing it can be… it can be fractured… broken in ways so that it rewires itself to withstand the stress of The Overlap.” 

“You turned children into tools!” Jordan spat in disgust. 

Surin looked away from the rear-view mirror and lowered his gaze without answering.  

“And so I’m your new tool,” Haddie said. There was a short silence as Haddie considered her last few investigations. She remembered finding journals in the old asylum that had notes about other realms. Memories of other people trapped in a deathless world and journal entries revealing thoughts about how artists and writers were able to somehow tune into these other worlds with what they believed was their imagination but what was actually their third eye. It was a strange theory that Haddie had dismissed as the ravings of a depraved lunatic with a wild imagination. But something the patient had written had stuck with her.  

The truth is in the story.   

Haddie whispered the words to herself and thought she would give those notebooks another read in case she had missed something. She had them stored in her studio apartment in Montreal and would force Stefan to make a detour before their next investigation.  

“You don’t understand,” Surin continued. “This isn’t just about the friends I lost… There are things in The Overlap we need to understand. There could be a new type of energy… a new way of seeing the world… the universe—”  

Jordan interrupted with a laugh. “Or... there’s nothing there… and it’s just a living hell.”

    The Entity is the mighty, malevolent being that created the nightmare realm of trials in which the Killers and Survivors are trapped.<br><br>Not much is known about The Entity, and it is rarely seen, except for when it manifests to claim its sacrificed Survivors. Some claim to have caught a glimpse of it in the deep, dark Fog beyond the trial walls. It was probably just their eyes playing tricks on them.

    Several survivors went mad trying to escape the trial. They had with them memories of previous incarnations so that one survivor began dashing his head against a wall convinced he was reliving a nightmare he had just escaped. The other survivors drowned him in mud to shut him up. It seems to me survivors are torches growing dimmer and dimmer with every trial. Some stop to feel altogether and are doomed to the void. Others go raving mad and need to be silenced by others.

    I have often wondered if those trapped here have ever paused to reflect upon the inexplicable significance of this world that defies not only time and space but death.

Sometimes I wonder if not all worlds were like this in some respect and that reality is what we in fact dream it to be or believe it to be.

    She didn't stop thinking about him since she first saw him. Now she hopes he shows up at her party. His rant stuck with her and she spent a few hours researching how education was corrupted to meet the demands of the industrial revolution. Conveyer belt education for assembly-line jobs. Nothing has changed for the last hundred years. Only the products. Frank shows up with drugs and drinks. Party treats. Julie introduces him to her best friends Joey and Susie. They talk favorite foods, slasher movies and killers all night. Julie amazes Frank with her profound knowledge of serial killers as she leads him to her bedroom and shows him her scrapbooks filled with pictures and clippings of famous murderers. Everyone leaves or passes out while Julie and Frank discuss murder and mayhem trying to one-up each other with details and trivia. Julie wins with a story of the abandoned cabin where the Soldiers of Mayhem hang out, plan and wreak havoc on the unsuspecting sheep of Ormond.  Frank laughs and calls bullshit on the story. No such thing as the Soldiers of Mayhem. He read enough about Ormond to know that nothing of the sort happened at the resort cabin. Nothing but bad business and bankruptcy. Julie laughs. This story, Frankie, happens in the future. She grabs a black felt marker and writes Soldiers of Mayhem on his white shirt. He smirks. I like the idea, but I hate the name. Julie shrugs. It's a work in progress.

    Evan's inspired in a way he's never been before. Furiously he sketches his father in a bear suit killing his uncle. He never met his uncle, but he's seen pictures. His uncle was a philanthropist. A bleeding heart. Disloyal. He would have run the business into the ground with proper wages and all that socialist crap. That's why he had to go. Evan doesn't have proof, but he knows. Deep down he knows his father murdered his uncle. Tied him up. Left him for a bear. There was no knife. No fight. No honor. Just a terrible death for a disloyal worm. Evan suspects all this and yet… he doesn't feel disgusted or ashamed. He feels something else. Something he's trying not to feel. Something… he won't admit to himself.

He chews on a fatty piece of rabbit and hopes his father doesn't say anything. He should have known better than to keep something from him. His father knows. He always knows. Last year Evan lost his cool on a man who said something about his mother. He almost beat the man to death with a two-by-four while his father watched and laughed. The authorities pulled Evan away. He smiled at Evan and knew what he wouldn't admit to himself. He enjoyed beating on that man. Not because of the insult. Not because he felt threatened. But because he felt… Powerful...

    Jake stands next to his father and brother by the sizzling barbeque and the turquoise, inground pool. He takes in the scent of thick, fatty, white bacon melting into mounds of burning black charcoal. He reaches around his father and pulls off a strip and devours it. His father smiles and says it’s like he’s never seen food before.  

Jake’s eyes widen as thick, droplets of grease drip off his chin. He suddenly pushes past his father and brother, attacking the grill, stuffing his face with greasy, life-giving fat and protein. His father tries to hold him back but Jake won’t be denied when suddenly the meat morphs into a living, wild hog. The hog turns to Jake and winks.  

Jake stumbles back and falls into the pool.  

The pool swirls and turns into a deadfall as several spikes rip through his chest. Jake yells in agony, waking up with a start, finding himself in a small pit beside thick, sharpened branches pointed outward.  

Jake wipes the sweat off his brow and slowly clambers to his feet. He climbs out of the deadfall and stares into the darkness of the cave for a long moment. Then he hears his mother’s soothing voice.  

Jake… please... finish the letter and send it to him.  

Why? What’s the use? It’s just gonna end up in a shoebox in the attic like his father’s letter.  

You’re wrong. It will be like the picture in his wallet.  

That’s just a stupid picture!  

Not to him.   
    The Deathslinger, a former bounty hunter with a chip on his shoulder is the new Killer. Following the massacre of those who had betrayed him at Hellshire Penitentiary, The Deathslinger was lured into the Realm of The Entity where he now uses his unique invention—a rifle that fires a chain—to round up Survivors for The Entity. 

The new Survivor is Zarina Kassir, a modern day cowboy using her camera and filmmaking skills to help those who cannot help themselves. As she investigated the circumstances around the  ‘Mad Mick Massacre’ at Hellshire prison, she unravelled more than she bargained for.

Samara Dwenlis, 33, is charged with first degree murder in the June 2037 killing of Kirsty Hartz, 67. The trial commenced on Thursday. Prosecutors said they would not entertain a plea of insanity despite the 911 call the suspect made claiming her mother-in-law was a vampire. The 911 call describes an ancient conspiracy with vampires who live among us and draw their powers from another dimension.
    People often speak of the tears of a clown, of the sadness that lies beneath the greasepaint smile. What if that wasn’t sadness, but a deep malevolence, born of a life spent in the pursuit of drink and gluttony? A mind that sees others only as vessels for torture, and reduces their bodies down to a single finger, a trophy to be added to a collection? For something like that to survive, it would have to wear a disguise, cloak itself in a brighter aspect and a broad smile, even if it were just painted on.<br><br>Kate Denson’s smile is genuine, friendly and warm. She sings of love and life, family and hope. She holds those values dear, and will fight anyone who tries to destroy them.

Events that should be long forgotten are recorded forever in the plaster and stone, pervading the building with misery. Only one part of the building is accurately reflected in this darkness.

    Hours? Days? Weeks? He’s not sure how much time has passed. His eyes never left the hatch as he repeated countless math problems in his mind to avoid facing the truth that she has disappeared with the rest of his people. He hears her voice, her laugh, her sighs. He wants to see her again. He wants to see his parents. His friends and neighbors. He wants to see them all. But he knows… his life will never be the same again and he would rather be dead than live without them. He closes his eyes and ascends into the cool night. The smell of rotting humanity instantly assaults his senses. Reminds him of roadkill left in the sun for days… only… worse… He searches the moonlight ground and soon finds his father’s bell by the charred, remains of a body. What happened? You were supposed to keep a look out? You were supposed to warn us. He takes the bell and cries out for his grandmother in a raspy whisper, but the whisper turns into an endless scream. He screams until he loses his voice, and all that answers back is the deafening silence of the cold, indifferent night. He falls to his knees, taps his bell with his finger, and wishes he could just disappear from this living nightmare.

    Survivors are very vulnerable and have few methods of fighting back against the Killer. To avoid being caught, they should start by learning how to hide. Basic strategies can include crouching behind obstacles, finding cover in tall grass, tucking into dark corners or getting into lockers. However, to avoid detection, Survivors must gain understanding of the Killer's heightened senses.<br><br><b>Scratch marks:</b> Running is louder than walking, but the real downside to running is the trail it leaves behind. These scratch marks can only be seen by the Killer. They disappear after a few seconds, but the trail they leave can lead the Killer straight to a running Survivor.<br><br><b>Loud Noises:</b> Some actions, such as window vaults, can be performed quickly or slowly (depending on whether the run button is held). Rushing these actions creates a loud noise signal that the Killer may see and hear. Be aware that these actions will give away your position. <br><br><b>Bloodstains:</b> Injured Survivors leave a trail of blood that is visible to all players. Survivors bleed regardless of whether they are walking or running. Bloodstains disappear after a few seconds.<br><br><b>Crows:</b> Crows are servants of The Entity. Survivors who startle them or get too close will cause them to caw loudly and take flight, which can tip off an attentive Killer.<br><br><b>Failed Skill Checks:</b> A failed Skill Check will create a loud noise signal for the Killer. Be very careful after failing a Skill Check! <br><br><i>Consult</i> <i><b>"The Killers"</b></i> <i>section of this guide for more information on the Killer's abilities.</i>

    Survivors have 3 health states: <b>healthy</b>, <b>injured</b> and <b>dying</b>.<br>As a Survivor, here's what each health state means to you:<br><br><b>Healthy:</b> Survivors start the trial in this state. Taking damage while healthy puts Survivors into the injured state.<br><br><b>Injured:</b> While injured, Survivors will bleed and grunt, making them easier to track. Though an injured Survivor limps, their movement speed is the same as when healthy. Taking damage while injured puts a Survivor into the dying state.<br><br><b>Dying:</b> While dying, a Survivor's movement is limited to a slow crawl. A crawling Survivor has two options: recover as much health as they can, or crawl to find help. Without the aid of specialized perks, a Survivor cannot recover fully; they will need another Survivor to finish healing them. A crawling Survivor can be picked up by the Killer and brought to a sacrificial hook.

Dust floats through the air, settles on her skin, more real than anything she ever believed. A lifetime of faith, security, crumbles.

    Nikki hands Philip back his bell in the dark night. It’s his turn to watch for killing crews, but he hasn’t slept in days and his eyelids are stones. He holds his bell close to his heart and for a moment just a moment he closes his eyes. Just for one minute. He awakens in the heat of morning with a start and a terrible feeling. He vaults to his feet and searches for his new friends. He finds one… pieces of one… of another… he’s not sure. He hears someone moaning. He searches and finds... Funanya… not dead but dying… sliced at every tendon… writhing in agony… covered in something golden… honey… they poured honey over her… and a million tiny black things swim, drown, and gorge on the gold and crimson streams dripping from her open wounds.  

The ants are crawling under her skin and eating her alive. He kneels beside her and tries to swap them away but it’s no use. They’re everywhere. Funanya whimpers and sputters blood as she tries to speak. But her tongue is missing and all that issues is a terrible, rattling noise. Philip kneels before her. He doesn’t know what to say or do. I fell asleep… I’m sorry… so sorry... but sorry doesn’t put her back together again. Sorry doesn’t get rid of the ants or bring back the children she was protecting. She barely scratches something with her finger in the dirt. I forgive.  

Philip stares at the words for a long moment. Silent tears fall as he raises his hand in front her face. She closes her eyes and waits for her suffering to end. He doesn’t want to do it, but he has to. He knows he has to. He closes his eyes and lowers his hand over her mouth and nose, and for a moment, just a moment, he becomes her angel of mercy.

The live-feed shows that Casey is swelling all over her body especially in her neck where tiny things seem to be moving under the skin. Nina is missing and what we understand… what we are reading in the comments is… she was pulled outside by a spider and dragged away.

    An idiot prods Bill into a room with some kind of make-shift electric poker. Watch that thing CEDA! The idiot prods him. We ain't CEDA. He pushes Bill into the corner with Francis and Zoey. He sees they got a geek on a computer. They're telling him to hack into the machine but he's telling them he can't. He's tech-savvy but he ain't no hacker. After a few tries they push him aside. They call him boy. He says his name is Louis, not boy and that gets him a gun shoved in his face. Geek has spunk and attitude. The survivalists talk amongst themselves. One of them sits in front of the laptop and hacks his way in. Bill overhears bits and parts. Search the computer for the locations of the safehouses. The flu took hold faster than anyone expected. Those who prepared the safehouses turned before they could use them. These assholes are mapping a path through the city using the safehouses as checkpoints like the old underground railway. Fitting for Philadelphia. They probably got hundreds of ideas on how they're going to use us. One of them grabs Zoey and has his own idea. Bill jackknifes to her side despite his restraints. Get your filthy mitts off her. The brute inches up to her and she gives him a kick he ain't ever gonna forget. Bill didn't think anyone could scream like that. He stares at Zoey with wide approving eyes. The brute continues to scream something terrible and collapses to his knees holding his gonads. His buddy rushes to his aid. Helps the screaming man up but… he looks different… real different... something in his eyes. Or rather something lacking in his eyes. Shit. Louis leaps back from the man like he were the plague. Francis panics. Get us out of this. Louis grabs a knife from the floor and frees Bill as the survivalists turn pale. Screams and yells echo around them as Bill frees Zoey and Louis frees Francis. They step back. Zoey gasps. What do we do? Bill shrugs and sighs. Nothing we can do for them. An infected suddenly charges Zoey. Francis clubs its head off. Merry Christmas! He looks to Bill for a reaction. Bill shakes his head and seems unimpressed. Find your own line, kid, if you've got the grey matter to do so. Francis scoffs. Louis adjusts his tie. Francis makes a face and nudges Louis. Lose the tie… Lose the god damn tie. Louis ignores him. Zoey motions for the boys to shut the hell up and follow her. Let's find an Island where we can rot on and then fight over ties. Bill raises an inspired eyebrow. That sounds like a plan. He actually likes the idea of rotting an island while the world goes to hell. Kid's right! Grab some gear and let's get outta here!

    Nea thinks about what Casey said as she lies in bed staring at a glass of water. Casey's right, and Nea remembers a time when she wanted to say so much as a street artist. Somehow that got stamped out of her. She tries to remember how it got stamped out of her. The only thing she can think about is… school. No messages. No politics. Nothing. Just inspire and entertain. Yet corporations have messages and politics. Politics of selling. She remembers being told not to use art for politics yet who does that benefit? Kings. Tyrant kings trying to own voices or stifle voices by creating an inner self-editor that begins in school. Keep politics out of it! Keep politics out of it? Everything is politics even the act of trying to stay out of politics. Politics… fuckin politics… fuckin corrupt mayor… Bastard didn't just switch good water for poison water… he sold the good water to a corporate king. Absurd. Ridiculous. Unbelievable. She never heard of such a thing. No one should own the rights to water. No one. Water belongs to everyone. To all living things. Nea stares at a spray paint can on her dresser. She thinks of something to say. Something to make people stop and take notice. For the first time in a long time she doesn't care if it's a message or a political statement. Screw her high school art teacher who made her feel insecure about making statements with her creations. Water is health. Water is strength. Water is a human right… Water is a human right… a basic human right.

    Whether Killers perform their heinous acts by the compulsions of their diseased minds, or if they are forced into them by external pressures, has long been a matter of debate. But for one Killer, nature and nurture are inextricably linked.<br><br>Leatherface kills not from a desire to exert his will over others, to satisfy carnal urges, or even to quiet the voices in his head. He kills because he is scared. Scared that others will hurt him; scared that his family will be displeased with him, scared that their shared willingness to eat human flesh will be discovered.<br><br>He does as he is told, his family loves him and that is all that matters. Outsiders are a threat, and threats need to be dealt with. <br><br>Like those kids that came into the house, uninvited. Walked in like they owned the place. Looked around the house, trying to find out his family’s secrets, no doubt. But Leatherface dealt with them, protected his family, just as he’d been taught.<br><br>He is not just protector, he has many roles, and each role has its own face. He serves dinner, cares for the family, dresses well when they eat. His Grandpa and Ma used to care for them all, but Grandpa is old now and she has been still for a while, so Leatherface and his brothers had to take over. Family is everything to him. Family is security and safety. <br><br>But, even though he did his best, one of the kids got away. He tried to stop her, chasing after her as fast as he could, but she had help: another outsider, driving a truck. The evil trucker killed his brother, ran him over like he was a possum. In a fury, Leatherface leapt at him, the saw ready to avenge his family, but the trucker was too quick. He knocked Leatherface aside and turned his own saw against him. <br><br>As he watched the outsiders driving away, the rage, grief and pain combined with the worry about what would happen to his family now. They would surely return with the police, and the police would take his brothers, his Grandpa. Without them, what would he do? Without their commands, he would wither and die.<br><br>As his world collapsed, Leatherface spun in circles, swinging the saw all around, trying to fight off the myriad external threats that surrounded him.<br><br>Then another feeling overtook him. It came from outside his vision, crawling over his skin with cold dread. He realised that no matter what outsiders could do to him, there was something worse, something bigger that lived in the shadows. He was filled with a terror unlike any he had ever felt before. But it was almost comforting, like the fear he’d felt with his family. The fear of disappointing them.<br><br>He was brought to a place that was familiar but unknowable, and he instinctively knew what he had to do. He couldn’t fail it, the way he had his family. Outsiders would come but he would use his skills to overcome any threats. There would be screaming, but he could make the world quiet again. Until the only sound remaining was the blessed howl of the saw.<br><br>Let the outsiders come.
    Like a real life superhero, it's time to don the uniform and stick up for the small guy.

    Philip Ojomo came to this country without anything other than hope for a new beginning. He was happy as he got offered a job at Autohaven Wreckers. A small scrap yard where bribed cops turned a blind eye on the somewhat shady business that took place. Ojomo didn’t care. He had seen criminal activity up close in his homeland, and as long as he didn’t get involved, he let things be. He just fixed cars and handled the crusher. Something he did really well. A car went in, a small, metallic cube came out.<br><br>It was not until one gloomy day that he, just by accident, saw some blood coming from one of the un-crushed cars. As he opened the trunk he found a young man, gagged with tied hands and panic filled eyes. Ojomo freed the man who managed to run ten feet before Ojomo’s boss stopped him and slit his throat. As Ojomo demanded answers he was explained that he’d been nothing more than a simple executioner as more or less every car had a soul in them. This was a "service" the scrap yard provided to certain "clients". Ojomo snapped and went ballistic. He threw his boss in the crusher and let it slowly compress, as the head stuck out, Ojomo grabbed it and pulled head and spine out of the body. Then he left, and was never seen again.<br><br>

    Returned to the make-shift lab today and found dozens of people wrapped in silk hanging from the ceiling. Blood dripped in sticky pools right under them. I tried to look away as I grabbed the crate of toxins that we had left behind. But as I carried the crate into the corridor, I couldn’t help but notice in the corner of my eye that one of those pods started to move. I forced myself to look and very quickly realized that these pods weren’t filled with food but with something else. It was clear that something was moving and growing inside the cocoon. Something was feeding off the dripping body parts that had been wrapped with it. The groaning creature inside the cocoon struggled to break free, and I instantly rushed out of the lab as fast as my trembling legs could take me. The last thing I wanted was to confront the latest arachna evolution. The arachnas mutate faster than we kill them, and finding the right toxin is our only chance at survival. Let’s hope the doctor and I do so before it’s too late.

    I have seen into the heart of this Old One and have seen things no mortal eyes should see... things that simultaneously perplex my mind and burden my conscience. With mysterious help I have ripped open reality, searched deep within countless rifts and seen everything tumble helplessly toward chaos and entropy… toward death and madness… and for the briefest moment I had the ridiculous thought that the mysterious ally helping me could very well be The Entity playing it’s game with me, toying with me as a cat does a mouse before the claw rips the tiny jugular out. Staring out into the endless abyss of black fog I thought that this prison could very well be another form of trial disguised and designed to feast on all the psychic energies derived from alienation, boredom and all those bouts of unremembered insanity. I can’t help but feel millions of invisible hooks in my heart and millions of unseen eyes all around me… watching me… waiting for me to tumble toward chaos and madness like everything else… waiting for my mind to turn against itself. This bastard of an Old One wants me to kill myself. I am sure of it. Or maybe... Maybe I already have, and maybe I will again… and again… and again…

    <b>Stories from the Witch Café. The Forever Horror.</b> Welcome one, welcome all, to the Moonstone! Please enjoy today's special, Pumpkin Ghoul Pie with, may I suggest, a cup of Franken Spice Coffee while I do my best to entertain you with tonight's story. This one comes from a challenge I received from friends to tell a scary story that could go on forever. I'm not sure if it's as scary as it's gross, but it's certainly fitting for Halloween and it takes place in Medieval, Europe.  I call this one, Tiny Awful Things, but my friends are telling me I should probably call it, The Forever Horror. Have a listen and let's discuss afterwards.<br><br>There was no doubt: Lucian was a coward. He was strong and clever and fast, but a coward, nevertheless. That's what made being drafted into the king's army and marched into battle all the worse. Not wanting to put himself in harm's way, Lucian thought of a clever plan to avoid injury or even death. <br><br>As soon as the horns blared and the infantry charged into the fray, Lucian executed his cowardly plan. He let loose a war-cry like none other, rushed forward with his sword raised, then, when no one was looking, when he heard the clash of iron and the agonizing screams of dying soldiers, he made himself tumble to the ground where he played dead and hoped for the best.<br><br>Lucian was so scared that despite the stink of rotting humanity he kept his eyes closed for several days until he felt someone or something tapping his shoulder. When he opened his eyes, he found himself staring up at a man in dark robes, holding a bloody scythe. <br><br>Lucian was staring at Death. <br><br>Or, at least, that's what he thought. <br><br>Actually, it wasn't Death at all, but a lower dimensional demon making the rounds, making mischief, pretending to be Death, looking for someone, anyone, to torment. And if you know anything about lower dimensional demons you know that they absolutely delight in tormenting cowards—cowards and narcissists. <br><br>And so, this lower dimensional demon stared at Lucian with glowing red eyes and told him his time had come and asked if he had any last requests.  Lucian, of course, extended a trembling hand and begged for his life. As the demon laughed and shook its ugly head, a thought came to Lucian, and he quickly begged for one last meal. <br><br>The demon stepped back, smiled, and said he would entertain his last request. He told him he would allow him to live for as much time it would take for him to fill his belly with whatever he could find on this battlefield… no… not battlefield… buffet… this buffet of death. <br><br>Lucian didn't know what to do. He didn't know what to eat. He wasn't a cannibal, and he certainly didn't want to commit any kind of sin before dying. He was about to surrender to his fate when he felt something squirm by his hand. He looked down and that's when he saw the… tiny, awful things… squirming out of the bloated belly of a corpse… falling on his hand. <br><br>Desperate, Lucian did the unthinkable. With a miserable sigh, he plunged his hand into the rotting belly, felt around the stinking, oozing innards and soon pulled out a dangling white maggot. <br><br>Swallowing a thickness in his throat, he held the tiny, awful thing up in the moonlight, then opened his mouth and let the maggot plop onto his tongue.  
The demon winced in disgust, laughed in disbelief, then said some words in a strange, unknown language. <br><br>Lucian didn't understand any of it, but he thought he might have been cursed as he strangely began to feel a great insatiable hunger for maggots.  More than this, he even began savoring them as one might savor a fine wine or coffee, enjoying, to his disbelief, the aftertaste. <br><br>I guess we can say that as a coffee bean soaks up the essence of the tree and land it grows upon, a maggot soaks up the essence of the corpse it feeds upon. <br><br>The demon smiled at Lucian as he desperately tried to delay the inevitable. When Lucian finally finished savoring the maggot, the demon told him his time was up. <br><br>But Lucian shook his head and said his belly wasn't full yet. Then he approached a corpse that had been crushed by a club.  Blood and gore spilled out of the eye sockets like spaghetti and meatballs. And there in the spaghetti and meatballs tiny, awful things squirmed. Lucian plucked another maggot and plopped it onto his greedy, salivating, tongue. <br><br>Robust. Earthy. Slimy. A velvety maggot that bursts with herbal notes and soothes with its fresh and bold character. <br><br>The demon smiled at the coward and said his time was up. <br><br>But Lucian shook his head and said his belly wasn't full yet. Then he approached a corpse that had been diced into small pieces by an ax. Chunks of bone and intestine festered in pools of blood like stew. And there in the stew tiny, awful things squirmed. Lucian plucked another maggot and plopped it onto his tongue. <br><br>Bold, yet fruity. Chewy. A sweet maggot with delicate hints of citrus. <br><br>The demon smiled at the coward and said his time was up. <br><br>Lucian shook his head and said his belly wasn't full yet. Then he approached a corpse that had been trampled by horses and marching soldiers. Pieces of skull and brain fermented in bile and blood like a delicious dipping sauce for veggies. And there in the dipping sauce tiny, awful things squirmed. Lucian plucked another maggot and plopped it onto his tongue. <br><br>Herbal. Intense. Mushy. A full-bodied maggot rich in flavor. <br><br>The demon smiled at the coward and said his time was up…and as you can imagine the story goes on and on cause the demon enjoyed watching this coward grovel like a maggot for his life. And since it goes on and on, I would appreciate some help telling it… at least until we run out of tiny, awful things. <br><br>Please pass this bowl of putrid guts and gore around the Moonstone. I invite you to reach inside and choose a tiny, awful thing to savor. <br><br>Please feel free to describe its flavors and let's not spare any gory, juicy, mushy details. <br><br>Okay, okay. I confess... They aren't real maggots, but slimy, sugary things soaking in warm brandy and pumpkin guts… but let's stick our hands in anyway and have a little fun to help us get into the spirit of Halloween.

    VICIOUS VICTORIAN
    Jake tries to spit the rancid taste of regurgitated bird out of his mouth as he tracks the boar. His stomach rejected most of what he tried to stuff into it, but he’s grateful he got some nourishment for his starving cells. He can’t even begin to imagine what it would be like to guide and care for others in the middle of nowhere. How’d he do it? How’d he feed them? How’d he lead them out of the woods with soldiers tracking them?  

Jake stops suddenly to examine a few broken twigs. He brings his focus back to the hunt, trying to determine which direction the hog took. Then he hears it.  

Snorting.  

Almost inaudible, but he hears it. He turns toward a patch of shuffling high grass and narrows his gaze. The snorting grows louder and louder. He’s laughing at me! Sunnava bitch, is laughing at me!  

You aren’t worthy, kid!  

The hell I’m not!  

Jake launches his spear into the moving grass. A high pitch squeal follows, and the hog jolts away!  

Jake surges after him, tracking a trail of red to the mouth of a small cave. He laughs to himself and knows he will feast tonight. He’s done!   

So sure?  

I searched that cave before… there’s no other way out. It’s just a matter of time and patience.   

And focus… Jake… focus…
